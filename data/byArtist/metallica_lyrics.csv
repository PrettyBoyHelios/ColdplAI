4,Metallica,Brandenburg Gate,"I would cut my legs and tits off  
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski  
In the dark of the moon  
It made me dream of Nosferatu  
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau  
Oh wouldn't it be lovely  
  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
  
I was thinking Peter Lorre  
When things got pretty gory as I  
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate  
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping  
As I just ate  
A following heart can tear you apart  
On a midnight to eight shift  
A graveyard romance can only give one chance  
As the tombstones weave and breathe  
  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
  
Feeling happy when my heart got beating  
On a Sunday afternoon  
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses  
And stars were still illumed  
I have three hearts that I keep apart  
Trying to relate  
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling  
And some absinthe drunk so late  
  
Small town girl  
My small town girl  
  
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk  
Onto the size of dessert plates  
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy  
And some opium to set me straight  
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl  
While my looks still hold me straight  
  
Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion  
Of reality mixed with drink  
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl  
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate  
  
Small town giving it a whirl  
Brandenburg Gate

Undamaged destiny  
Can't get caught in the endless circle  
Ring of stupidity

One with my mind, they just can't see  
No need to hear things that they say  
Life is for my own to live my own way  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings  
Don't tell me what to do  
I don't care now, because I'm on my side  
And I can see through you  
Feed my brain with your so called standards  
Who says that I am not right  
Break away from your common fashion  
See through your blurry sight

Out for my own, out to be free  
One with my mind, they just can't see

Push your pins in make us humble

If we fall or merely stumble  
But tell me  
Can you heal what father's done  
Or fix this hole in a mother's son  
Can you heal the broken worlds within  
Can you strip away so we may start again  
Tell me can you heal what father's done  
Or cut this rope and let us run  
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free  
You jab another pin  
Jab another pin in me  
Yeah  
Mirror, mirror upon the wall  
Break the spell or become the doll  
See you sharpening the pins  
So the holes will remind us  
We're just the toys in the hands of another  
And in time the needles turn from shine to rust  
But tell me  
Can you heal what father's done  
Or fix this hole in a mother's son  
Can you heal the broken worlds within  
Can you strip away so we may start again  
Tell me, can you heal what father's done  
Or cut this rope and let us run  
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free  
You jab another pin  
Jab another pin in me

Sweat for dirt  
Three X's for the stone  
To break this curse  
A ritual's due  
I believe I'm not alone  
Shell of shotgun  
Pint of gin  
Numb us up to shield the pins  
Renew our faith  
Which way we can  
To fall in love with life again  
To fall in love with life again  
To fall in love with life again  
To fall in love  
To fall in love  
To fall in love with life again

Or fix this hole in a mother's son  
Can you heal the broken worlds within  
Can you strip away so we may start again  
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done

17,Metallica,Hero Of The Day,"Mama, they try and break me.  
The window burns to light the way back home  
A light that warms no matter where they've gone.  
They're off to find the hero of the day  
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?  
Still the window burns, time so slowly turns  
Someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames  
Do you feel your names?  
Do you hear your babies crying?  
Mama they try and break me  
Still they try and break me  
'Scuse me while I tend to how I feel  
These things return to me that still seem real  
Now deservingly this easy chair  
But the rocking stops by wheels of despair  
Don't want your aid  
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feel  
No I'm not all me  
So please excuse me while I tend to how I fell  
But now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night (echoed
between James and Jason)  
  
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's light  
Can you hear your babies crying now?  
Still the window burns  
Time so slowly turns  
And someone there is sighing  
Keepers of the flames, can't you feel your names?

Ever last the night  
So build a wall behind it crawl

If I was half drowning  
An arm above the last wave  
  
Would you come to me  
Would you pull me up  
Would the effort really hurt you  
Is it unfair to ask you  
To help pull me up  
  
The window broke the silence of the matches  
The smoke effortlessly floating  
  
Pull me up  
Would you be my lord and savior  
Pull me up by my hair  
Now would you kiss me, on my lips  
  
Burning fever burning on my forehead  
The brain that once was listening now  
Shoots out its tiresome message  
  
Won't you pull me up  
Scalding, my dead father  
Has the motor and he's driving towards  
An island of lost souls  
  
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey  
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness  
No social redeeming kindness  
Or oh, state of grace  
  
Would you pull me up  
Would you drop the mental bullet  
Would you pull me by the arm up  
Would you still kiss my lips  
Hiccup, the dream is over  
Get the coffee, turn the lights on  
Say hello to junior dad  
The greatest disappointment  
Age withered him and changed him  
Into junior dad  
Psychic savagery  
  
The greatest disappointment  
The greatest disappointment  
Age withered him and changed him

32,Metallica,Mercyful Fate,"They're walking by the night  
The moon has frozen blue  
Long black coats a shelter for the rain  
Their load must get through  
Now bats are leaving their trees  
They're joining the call  
Seven satanic Hell preachers heading for the hall  
Bringing the blood of a newborn child  
Got to succeed if not it's Satan's fall  
  
Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings  
Where the mummified pharaohs  
Pretend dead in their sleep  
Don't touch, never ever steal  
Unless you're in for the kill  
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs  
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you  
  
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly  
Just destroying your future  
Makin' it all shady  
Don't touch, never ever steal  
Unless you're in for the kill (for the kill)  
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs  
Yes you'll be hit and the curse is on you  
  
Listen, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse  
I'm a corpse without soul  
Satan, he's taken, he's taken  
He's taken his toll  
And he took it on me  
  
I, I'm trapped, I'm trapped  
I'm trapped in his spell  
Tonight, I'm going, I'm going  
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell  
  
Howl like a wolf  
And a witch will open the door  
Follow me and meet our high priestess  
Come, come into my coven  
And become Lucifer's child  
  
Undress until you're naked  
And put on this white coat  
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring  
Come, come into my coven  
And become Lucifer's child  
  
I was born on the cemetery  
Under the sign of the moon  
Raised from my grave by the dead  
And I was made a mercenary  
In the legions of Hell  
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane  
  
You know my only pleasure  
Is to hear you cry  
I'd love to hear you cry  
I'd love to see you die  
And I'll be the first  
To watch your funeral  
And I'll be the last to leave  
I'd love to hear you cry  
  
And when you're down beyond the ground  
I'll dig up your body again  
And make love to shame  
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)  
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye  
You've gotta say goodbye  
'Cause I will eat your mind

I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place  
I stitch them up, see not my fall from grace  
I blind my eyes, I hardly feel it passing me by  
I open just in time to say goodbye  
  
Almost like your life  
Almost like your endless fight  
Cursed, the day is long  
Realize you don't belong  
Disconnect somehow  
Never stop complaining now  
Almost like your fight  
And there it went  
Almost like your life  
  
Like a bullet, keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think  
Like a raging river, drowning when I only need a drink  
Like a poison that I swallow, but I want the world to die  
  
Like a release from a prison that I didn't know I was in  
Like a fight to live the present, I pictured it like this  
Like a general without a mission until the wars start again  
Start again  
  
I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place

But the sunshine never comes, no  
No, the sunshine never comes  
  
Push you cross that line  
Just stay down this time  
Hide in yourself  
Crawl in yourself

Take it back one day  
I'll end this day  
I'll splatter color on this grave

For now you have got some company

They have come to take your life  
On through the dead of night  
With the four Horsemen ride  
Or choose your fate and die  
  
You have been dying since the day  
You were born  
You know it has all been planned  
The quartet of deliverance rides  
A sinner once a sinner twice  
No need for confession now  
'Cause now you have got the fight of your life

On the leather steeds they ride  
They have come to take your life  
On through the dead of night

Or choose your fate and die  
  
Time  
Has taken its toll on you  
The lines that crack your face  
Famine  
Your body it has torn through  
Withered in every place  
Pestilence  
For what you have had to endure  
And what you have put others through  
Death  
Deliverance for you for sure  
There is nothing you can do  
  
So gather round young warriors now  
And saddle up your steeds  
Killing scores with demon swords  
Now is the death of doers of wrong  
Swing the judgment hammer down  
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat

On the leather steeds they ride  
They have come to take your life  
On through the dead of night

Stitch me together  
Save me

Remind me of what left this outlaw torn

Set before me  
  
I attract you and repel you

Is a challenge that our youth  
Must quickly conquer  
There is no time for guilt  
Or second guessing, second guessing  
Based on feeling  
  
I am the truth, the beauty  
That causes you to cross  
Your sacred boundaries  
  
I have no morals  
Some think me cheap  
And someone who despises  
The normalcy of heartbreak  
The purity of love  
  
But I worship the young  
And just formed angel  
Who sits upon the pin of lust  
Everything else  
Bores me  
I want to see your suicide  
I want to see you give it up  
  
Your life of reason  
I want you on the floor  
And in a coffin your soul shaking  
I want to have you doubting  
Every meaning you've amassed  
Like a fortune  
  
Oh throw it away

Gazing up to the breeze of the heavens

Curiosity teasing everyone

What I've felt  
What I've known  
Sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
Come lay beside me  
This won't hurt, I swear  
She loves me not  
She loves me still  
But she'll never love again  
She lay beside me  
But she'll be there when I'm gone  
Black heart scarring darker still  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone  
Dead sure she'll be there  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
Yeah  
What I've felt

I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you  
Or are you unforgiven too?  
Lay beside me  
Tell me what I've done  
The door is closed, so are your eyes  
But now I see the sun  
Now I see the sun  
Yes, now I see it  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone

So sick and tired  
I stand alone  
Could you be there  
'Cause I'm the one who waits  
The one who waits for you  
Oh  
What I've felt  
What I've known  
Turn the pages  
Turn the stone  
Behind the door  
Should I open it for you?  
So I dub thee unforgiven  
Oh, what I've felt  
Oh, what I've known  
I take this key  
And I bury it in you  
Because you're unforgiven too  
Never free  
Never me  
'Cause you're unforgiven too  
Oh

81,Metallica,Unnamed Feeling,"Been here before (x6)  
  
Been here before, couldn't say I liked it  
Do I start writing all this down?  
Just let me plug you into my world  
Can't you help me be uncrazy?  
  
Name this for me, heat the cold air  
Take the chill off of my life  
And if I could I'd turn my eyes  
To look inside to see what's comin'  
  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
And I die a little more  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
Each moment here I die a little more  
  
Then the unnamed feeling  
It comes alive  
Then the unnamed feeling  
Takes me away  
  
Been here before (x6)  
  
I'm frantic in your soothing arms  
I can not sleep in this down filled world  
I've found safety in this loneliness  
But I can not stand it anymore  
  
Cross my heart, hope not to die  
Swallow evil, ride the sky  
Lose myself in a crowded room  
You fool, you fool, it'll be here soon  
  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive...  
It comes alive  
And I die a little more  
It comes alive...

Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little more

And I wait for this train  
Toes over the line

Get the fuck out of here  
I just want to get the fuck away from me  
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate  
I hate it all, Why? Why? Why me?

82,Metallica,Until It Sleeps,"Where do I take this pain of mine  
I run, but it stays right my side  
  
So tear me open, pour me out  
There's things inside that scream and shout  
And the pain still hates me  
So hold me, until it sleeps  
  
Just like the curse, just like the stray  
You feed it once, and now it stays  
  
So tear me open, but beware  
There's things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me, until I'm clean  
  
It grips you, so hold me  
It stains you, so hold me  
It hates you, so hold me  
It holds you, so hold me  
  
Until it sleeps  
  
So tell me why you've chosen me  
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed  
  
I'll tear me open, make you gone  
No more can you hurt anyone  
And the fear still shakes me  
So hold me, until it sleeps  
  
It grips you, so hold me  
It stains you, so hold me  
It hates you, so hold me  
It holds you, so hold me  
  
Until it sleeps  
  
I don't want it  
  
So tear me open, but beware  
The things inside without a care  
And the dirt still stains me  
So wash me, 'till I'm clean  
  
I'll tear me open, make you gone  
No longer will you hurt anyone

85,Metallica,Welcome Home (Sanitarium),"Welcome to where time stands still  
No one leaves and no one will  
Moon is full, never seems to change  
Just labeled mentally deranged  
Dream the same thing every night  
I see our freedom in my sight  
No locked doors, no windows barred  
No things to make my brain seem scarred  
  
Sleep my friend and you will see  
That dream is my reality  
They keep me locked up in this cage  
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage  
  
Sanitarium, leave me be  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
  
Build my fear of what's out there  
And cannot breathe the open air  
Whisper things into my brain  
Assuring me that I'm insane  
They think our heads are in their hands  
But violent use brings violent plans  
Keep him tied, it makes him well  
He's getting better, can't you tell?  
  
No more can they keep us in  
Listen, damn it, we will win  
They see it right, they see it well  
But they think this saves us from our Hell  
  
Sanitarium, leave me be  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
Sanitarium, just leave me alone  
  
Fear of living on  
Natives getting restless now  
Mutiny in the air  
Got some death to do  
Mirror stares back hard  
Kill, it's such a friendly word  
Seems the only way  
For reaching out again.

Termination....expiration...cancellation...human race  
Expectation...liberation...population...lay to waste  
See our mother  
Put to death  
See our mother die  
Smoldering decay  
Take her breath away  
Millions of our years  
In minutes disappears  
Darkening in vain  
Decadence remains  
All is said and done  
Never is the sun  
Never  
  
Fire

Darkest potency  
In the exit of humanity  
Color our world blackened

Bodies fill the fields I see  
The slaughter never ends  
  
Soldier boy, made of clay  
Now an empty shell  
Twenty one, only son  
But he served us well  
Bred to kill, not to care  
Do just as we say  
Finished here, greetings death  
He's yours to take away  
  
Back to the front  
You will do what I say, when I say  
Back to the front  
You will die when I say, you must die  
Back to the front  
You coward  
You servant  
You blind man  
  
Why, am I dying?  
Kill, have no fear  
Lie, live off lying  
Hell, hell is here  
  
I was born for dying  
  
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say  
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day  
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done  
Left to die with only friend  
Alone I clench my gun  
  
Soldier boy, made of clay  
Now an empty shell  
Twenty one, only son  
But he served his will  
Bred to kill, not to care  
Do just as we say  
Finished here, greetings death  
He's yours to take away  
  
Back to the front  
You will do what I say, when I say  
Back to the front  
You will die when I say, you must die

Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail  
Never begins it, never, but once engaged  
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage  
Don't tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore  
Don't tread on me  
  
Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite  
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike  
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance  
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance  
Don't tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score

He wakes giving earth its bleeding  
Pure madness alive

Inhaling black skies

Hidden from this thing that they call life

Curator  
Dictator  
Always censoring my every move

Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly

Time has frozen still what's left to be  
Hear nothing  
Say nothing  
Cannot face the fact I think for me  
No guarantee, it's life as is  
But damn you for not giving me my chance  
  
Dear mother  
Dear father  
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly unspoiled  
Unspoken  
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby  
Same thing I've always heard from you  
Do as I say not as I do  
  
Innocence  
Torn from me without your shelter  
Barred reality  
I'm living blindly

Cannot cope without you two  
Shocked at the world that I see  
Innocent victim please rescue me

Dreams of dragon's fire  
And of things that will bite

Truth is an offense  
You silence for your confidence

Do you feel what I feel?  
Bittering distress  
Who decides what you express  
Do you take what I take?  
Endurance is the word  
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom with their exception

Truths to you are lies to me

117,Metallica,Fade To Black,"Life it seems will fade away  
Drifting further everyday  
Getting lost within myself  
Nothing matters no one else  
I have lost the will to live  
Simply nothing more to give  
There is nothing more for me  
Need the end to set me free  
  
Things not what they used to be  
Missing one inside of me  
Deathly loss this can't be real  
Can't stand this hell I feel  
Emptiness is filling me  
To the point of agony  
Growing darkness taking dawn  
I was me but now, he's gone  
  
No one but me can save myself, but it's too late  
Now I can't think, think why I should even try  
  
Yesterday seems as though it never existed  
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye  
Goodbye

Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear

Time is like a fuse, short and burning fast  
Armageddon is here, like said in the past  
  
Fight fire with fire  
Ending is near  
Fight fire with fire  
Bursting with fear  
  
Soon to fill our lungs the hot winds of death  
The gods are laughing, so take your last breath

Constant chill deep inside  
Shooting gun, on they run through the endless grey  
On they fight, for the right, yes, but who's to say?  
For a hill men would kill, why? They do not know  
Suffered wounds test their pride  
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow  
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Take a look to the sky just before you die  
It is the last time he will  
Blackened claw massive roar fills the crumbling sky  
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry  
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery  
He hears the silence so loud  
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be  
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see  
  
For whom the bell tolls  
Time marches on  
For whom the bell tolls

Beyond the black

If the effort's too high no matter who you are  
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars  
It doesn't matter who you are

Now me I've tried a million tricks  
To make life cold and make it stick  
Not running heat that flames then out  
But the proud piece of ice that always floats  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee  
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be  
If no matter how much soul and heart  
I put to the wood  
If a flaming heart is not that good  
Iced honey, iced honey  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
If violence mars your final hour  
If you make others feel like jam  
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb  
  
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout  
And your oxygen starts to run out  
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong  
And instead of hello you say so long  
If your energy starts to leak out  
And people wonder what you're all about  
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart  
The story of love gives them all a start  
  
And me, I've always been this way  
Not by choice, just this way  
I can't put my honey pot in a jar  
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy  
  
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar  
No wonder no need to wonder where you are  
It might seem like hell, the River Styx  
Your affection never sticks  
  
No matter what you say, no matter what you do  
A butterfly heart flies right past you  
There's nothing to say, nothing to do  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
Iced honey, ah ah ah iced honey  
Iced honey, iced honey  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you  
See if the ice will melt for you

Come home where you belong

136,Metallica,One (Rare),"The cerebrum has suffered massive and reparable damage  
You never know what has happened to him  
If I have not been sure of this, I would not have permitted him to live  
Where am I? Father, what happened? I need help  
  
What is democracy? What is democracy?  
It got something to do with young men killing each other, Arthur  
What if its my turn, will you want me to go?  
For democracy, any man would give his only begotten son  
  
It is impossible for any severed individual to experience pain  
Pleasure, memory, dream or thought of any kind  
This young man will be as unfeeling as unthinking as the dead  
Until the day joins them  
  
I don't know weather I'm alive or dreaming or dead or remembering  
How can you tell what's a dream and what's real  
When you can't even tell when your awake and when your asleep  
Where am I?  
  
I can't remember anything  
Can't tell if this is true or dream  
Deep down inside I feel to scream  
This terrible silence stops with me  
  
Now that the war is through with me  
I'm waking up, I cannot see  
That there's not much left of me  
Nothing is real but pain now  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh, please God, wake me  
  
They kept my head and chopped off everything  
Oh, God, please make them hear me  
They won't listen, they wont hear me  
They got to wake me up Ill be like this for years, hear me  
  
Back in the womb it's much too real  
In pumps life that I must feel  
But can't look forward to reveal  
Look to the time when I'll live  
  
Fed through the tube that sticks in me  
Just like a wartime novelty  
Tied to machines that make me be  
Cut this life off from me  
  
Hold my breath as I wish for death  
Oh, please God, wake me  
It's like a piece of me

Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
  
Can you help me?  
Occupy my brain?  
Oh yeah  
  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

143,Metallica,Remember Tomorrow,"Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire

144,Metallica,Ride The Lightning,"Guilty as charged  
But dammit, it ain't right  
Someone else controlling me  
  
Death in the air  
Strapped in the electric chair  
This can't be happening to me  
  
Who made you God to say  
""I'll take your life from you!""  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Wait for the sign  
To flick the switch of death  
It's the beginning of the end  
  
Sweat, chilling cold  
As I watch death unfold  
Consciousness my only friend  
  
My fingers grip with fear  
What I am doing here?  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain  
  
Someone help me  
Oh please God help me  
They're trying to take it all away  
I don't want to die  
  
Time moving slow  
The minutes seem like hours  
The final curtain call I see  
  
How true is this?  
Just get it over with  
If this is true, just let it be  
  
Wakened by horrid screams  
Freed from this frightening dream  
  
Flash before my eyes  
Now it's time to die  
Burning in my brain  
I can feel the pain

145,Metallica,Ronnie,"Stories taught  
Quiet town  
Small time for big time crowd  
Never talks  
Never plays  
Different path  
Lost his way  
The streets are red  
Red I'm afraid  
There's no confetti  
No parade  
Nothing happens in this boring place  
But oh my god how it all did change  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
I heard it  
He said  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
I always said  
Something wrong  
Little strange  
All day long  
Never laugh  
Never smile  
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles  
Yellow comes  
Sun I say  
Keep your smile and laugh all day  
He falls again in this foreign place  
For little boys how they do chase  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
I heard it  
He said  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
(Spoken)  
Yeah, well all the green things died  
When Ronnie moved to this place  
He said  
""Don't you dare ask  
Why I'm cursed to wear this face""  
I know why the children called him Ronnie frown  
When he pulled that gun from his pocket  
They all fall down down down  
He said  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
I heard it  
He screamed  
""Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way""  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today

148,Metallica,Smoke On The Water,"(Originally recorded by Deep Purple)  
We all came out to Montreux  
On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn't have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
They burned down the gamblin' house,  
It died with an awful sound  
A funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water  
We ended up at the Grand Hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know, I know we'll never forget  
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky, smoke on the water

149,Metallica,Some Kind Of Monster,"These are the eyes that can't see me  
These are the hands that drop your trust  
These are the boots that kick you around

These are the ears that ring with hate  
This is the face that'll never change  
This is the fist that grinds you down  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
These are the legs in circles run  
This is the beating you'll never know  
These are the lips that taste no freedom  
This is the feel that's not so safe  
This is the face you'll never change  
This is the God that ain't so pure  
This is the God that is not pure

Some kind of monster...

These are the claws that scratch these wounds  
This is the pain that never leaves  
This is the tongue that whips you down  
This is the burden of every man  
These are the screams that pierce your skin  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
This is the test of flesh and soul  
This is the trap that smells so good  
This is the flood that drains these eyes  
These are the looks that chill to the bone  
These are the fears that swing over head  
These are the weights that hold you down  
This is the end that will never end

And didn't you hear me you never listen past  
And didn't I see you gone to seed  
And the only reason is that you're too young greed  
  
You're out there on your own  
Your face turned to stone  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
You're in perhaps you'll listen a judge like you  
In your sweet life innocence that's nobody's fault  
You've never had it quite so good  
Because you didn't know that you even could  
  
At times it's been too old  
Your judge turned to gold  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever  
  
And it's been a long, long time been a long, long wait  
And then you thought you'd beat us at the pearly gates  
You better leave your number, oh and we'll call you  
You must admit your problem and it's heckling you  
  
The time has come to pay  
Turns out you've been the prey  
Whatever happened to your life  
Stone dead forever

152,Metallica,Wherever I May Roam,"And the road becomes my bride  
I have stripped of all but pride  
So in her I do confide  
And she keeps me satisfied  
Gives me all I need  
And with dust in throat I crave  
Only knowledge will I save  
To the game you stay a slave  
  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
Free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
And the earth becomes my throne  
I adapt to the unknown  
Under wandering stars I've grown  
By myself but not alone  
I ask no one  
  
And my ties are severed clean  
The less I have the more I gain  
Off the beaten path I reign  
Rover, wanderer  
Nomad, vagabond  
Call me what you will  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll never mind anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
  
But I'll take my time anywhere  
I'm free to speak my mind anywhere  
And I'll redefine anywhere  
Anywhere I roam  
Where I lay my head is home  
Carved upon my stone  
My body lie, but still I roam  
Wherever I may roam
