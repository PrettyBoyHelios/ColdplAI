0,"One year, two years, time goes by.  
People laugh and people cry.  
Every morning the clock strikes eight.  
I go to work.  
I close the gate.  
And on my way, I sing a song.  
About my wife, where I belong.  
  
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see.  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me.  
Only you can see me.  
  
For what I've got  
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not  
For I am he with something more  
It's you and I reality.  
  
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather  
If it's rain they anticipate  
Baby, make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me  
Only you can see me  
  
Two years on two years on

1,"I've discovered for myself this time  
The start of everything to me  
Is to know our love is older than the sea  
But don't let another flame inside  
Your fire-proof heart  
'Cause I'm not your full-time lover  
And it's tearing me apart  
I've been hangin' on this line too long

I know in your mind that you think  
It's a crime, but I had to call  
First and last , there will  
Never be a past or a future  
If you kill my phone  
  
Baby lifts her eyes

And I'm forever lost

I have suffered for my sins today  
With the pain of love  
Before the dawning comes  
The darker is the night  
I'm born to be the one to share your life  
That shows I don't need no operator  
I don't want no one to know  
How much I need you

2,"Woman in a million to me  
I've never loved so much  
Is it any wonder I'm alive  
No one ever knows what makes a  
Virtue or a vice  
Let it be the spell I'm under  
(These naked eyes)  
Let it be the rain and thunder comes  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, oh,  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold  
Love is the key and the cause  
And its makin' us whole  
  
Made me a little crazy, but I  
Soon realize my fate  
Every little touch I'm paralized  
No one ever knows what makes  
An angel in disguise  
Let me be the one to taste you  
Those naked eyes  
No pity if the city ever crumbles down  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, oh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and we share  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its ready for those who dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And I'm taking you there  
(And baby I'll take you there)  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives, ohh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is the key and the cause  
And it's making us whole  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its yours if you dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And I'm taking you there  
(Baby I'll take you there)  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives oh,  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
I'd give it all for you and me

3,"There is not anything I would not do to ease your troubled mind  
Where you are, there is a different feeling  
I wake up, I'm on the ceilin', opens up your eyes  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately  
  
[Chorus]  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately  
After dark where the lights start fading sweet and low  
I wanna be there, I wanna be there  
We leave immediately, after dark  
  
There is no limit that I would not go if I could lie beside  
Where you are, there is a different world out there  
Love in the jungle can be hard to realize  
What a shape, someone you can't forget for any time  
Oh, let me show you mine immediately

4,"Maybe you talk too high, man.  
Maybe I talk too slow.  
But you've got to live a little bit faster

I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the wind and make it blow the other way.  
I'm a fool and I can tell .  
  
That I'm alive and that's all.  
That I can get up just as fast as I fall.  
And I can walk and run but I'll never crawl.  
And in the end it doesn't matter at all.  
I don't know about the people that I read about in books.  
And the Kings and Queens around my room with their quiet dirty looks.  
I know I should be going somewhere, I just can't arrive .  
There's a reason for believing that I've never been alive , alive.  
  
I ain't lost and I ain't searching.  
But then you know me very well.  
And I can't change the world and make it go the other way.

'Cause my baby's no longer around  
And my feeling can never be found  
Another lonely night in New York  
And my sorry eyes are lookin' out on the world  
  
Baby , you said , a guy like me was way out of line  
And knowing today , your leavin' was a question of time  
In the mist of a sweet summer rain ,you will find me here  
Should the sparkle of stars lose their way ,  
I'll be holdin' near  
Another lonely night in New York

Where are you to keep me warm?  
  
I had a dream of a place far away.  
I followed a river where the dead man would play.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
And I'm leaving in the morning.  
  
And I won't die, so don't cry. I'll be home.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me.  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea.  
  
And you a man who's as tall as the sky  
Followed a river where thousands have died.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
He was leaving in the morning.  
  
If I come home and my women has flown.  
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me  
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Say goodbye to auld lang syne [Repeat until fade]

you are they who try and touch the wind.  
You could be the blessed one  
that makes me love you.  
  
And doing what you've never done before,  
taking every wave that hits the shore,  
you could be a silver star that shines  
on my blue island.  
It's gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
  
You can see the rain.  
You can feel the pain  
that no part of me is going through.  
  
Everybody say  
we can find a way.  
Do you know the place you're going to?  
  
You're going to a blue island.  
  
This is what the lonely heart must know.  
This is what it takes to make it grow.  
You could be a child alone.  
But you may save the world.  
  
Maybe it's the words that mean goodbye.  
There but for the grace of God go I.  
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island.  
  
Gonna be a blue island.  
See you on a blue island.  
Take you to a blue island.  
  
Blue island.  
Blue island.  
Blue island.

9,"It hurts me when you cry  
When you feel the love is gone  
Don't give up on us  
When you got so much to believe in  
And I beg you please stay  
Strangers in the night  
A flame that never dies  
In a world of lonely faces  
You need someone to survive  
A heart like yours  
Should never live alone

Lost inside  
It's only you and me  
  
There's things you shouldn't do  
You lose your self control  
Should the eyes of a perfect stranger  
Take you down to a new sensation  
Just turn back to me  
Don't wait till its gone  
Don't go where you don't belong  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours  
Should always find a home  
  
I know the signs and I'm telling you  
You're living on borrowed time  
But a heart needs love  
Like a flower needs rain  
Like I'm making you mine  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
What we had never known all our lives  
I pray its not too late  
I would die by your side my love  
I'm the life that you save  
In this world of pain and sorrow  
Every wish is your command  
A heart like yours should never live alone  
  
I used to dream of a special one  
And now I feel it coming true  
But I could'nt let go, I'm a jealous guy  
What you're putting me through  
I'm begging you  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far  
  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far my love, my life  
Let me be your bodyguard  
Living in my protection  
We can just get ignited  
Stop before we go too far, my love, my life  
  
Let me be your bodyguard  
I can be useful to you  
We can just get excited  
Stop before we go too far

My daddy put me n his knee and showed me the way to go

So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do""  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
If you got what it takes my boy  
You can always choose  
Work it out before it's too late my boy  
Make sure you never lose  
  
I'm glad I am born a man  
I'm glad I am born a man  
  
Born a man  
  
Every woman wants her man to live and learn on her land  
Where I go, baby you go

11,"I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a Ma and Pa  
Ev'rybody said the kid's no good  
  
Come Home Johnny Bride come home  
Johnny Bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad

Lonely days and nights (away from you).  
We can live our life

With our separate lives.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Lonely days and nights.  
I will never send away.  
Embrace, embrace.  
The lonely, lonely lives.  
Embrace the child inside  
The lonely, lonely lives.

Be tender with my love  
You know how easy it is to hurt me

17,"I'm so weary from holding this load  
But it's only, love for you, that I walk this lonely road  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
And the wind will take me hold before the cold  
  
Every stay I have counted  
Each flower I have seen  
But the place where I'm going, there's no grass as green  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
And the wind will take me home where I can dream  
  
In the hour I am lonely, you're love will be mine  
I will stay in your arms dear, until comes the time  
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere  
I have no time to stay, I have no time to care  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
I must follow the wind, follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair

"
18,"Take me to your world of wonder  
Let me come inside your room  
Invisible  
Now you see nothin'  
Some investigation as to the state of us  
No misunderstanding girl  
On either side  
  
I couldn't lie if I try any other way  
I can't stop thinking of that girl of mine  
I'm for the rise and the fall  
Any other way and  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
You shouldn't do it, you shouldn't do it  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Who can stop your past from rushing by  
Born to live one million stories high  
Into the night  
Into the day  
  
Take me to a town or country  
Stranger in a strange land  
And I'm an alien  
No you can't find me  
You be there at the station  
When the train arrives  
When it leaves I get my hands on you  
  
I fool myself if I turn any other way  
I still keep searchin' for that girl of mine  
I'm for the hell of it all  
  
Do it anyway and  
  
Oh  
Ride on my ghost train  
Oh  
Hearts can break and hearts can  
Turn the tide  
All is love and love is open wide  
Ghost train  
Ghost train  
Into the night  
Into the day

19,"I know that you want a man  
To love you like no other can  
Here I am , here I am  
I know that you want a boy  
To fill your lonely heart with joy  
Here I am , here I am  
I'm gonna prove that my love was made for only you  
If you don't believe me ,watch and you'll see me  
Make you love me too

20,"Cryin' in the streets  
They run for their lives  
How can you lead them to heaven  
They don't realize  
Children of the night  
How far can we fall  
That which we say is forever  
Ain't no time at all  
  
Father and the son  
Not too young to be old  
Reach out for each other when  
The world goes cold  
Feel so good to be home  
Are you ready for

My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization  
Are you ready for  
My high civilization

Everything for us to see  
The ultimate society  
  
Keeper of the sword  
You fight for your rights  
How can you live for the hour  
When there's no yesterday  
Dyin' in the streets  
Your number your name  
All that which keeps us together  
Is bringing us the pain  
  
Thunder of the guns  
Comes the criminal mind  
Working for the power of  
The evil eye  
We are never alone  
Uncivilized

New York, Paris, Tokyo  
Vienna to Berlin  
Baby don't know you

Cairo to Iran  
No city can hold you  
There's no one in Avalon to show you  
Minutes into seconds are you ready  
For the end

And have you loving me

You be there when we find salvation  
Only then will there be no reason to hide  
Stormy night out in the heaven  
I believe in the true forever  
There's a bright new star when somebody dies  
I cry to the wind

The day you learn love happened to you  
You will be here with me

I found a love, now not even friends  
Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do  
I was the child  
  
I held your hand and I told you things  
And I made you believe, believe in fairy tales  
And diamond rings

Tell me why  
Loving you , loving me like you used to do

And you took me for your own girl  
I lie beneath your ecstasy  
You can pour it all over me  
  
I won't break the chains of loving you  
We got everything , anybody needs  
And it's here with me ,with you

But that was just the way we were  
  
'Til you make a world of love in you  
We got everything , anybody needs

You do something to me that I can't explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other, ah ha  
From one lover to another, ah ha  
  
I can't live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together, ah ha  
Making love with each other, ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me

A chip on my shoulder, a misery, suddenly there you are  
Nobody knows, but she knows that I love her

You disappear into the crowd  
Maybe the beautiful woman never really came  
But I still call your name out loud  
I want to know you , but I never met you  
Reality can be cruel  
If a wandering soul meets another  
They shouldn't be separated  
Better in love with your head on my shoulder  
But I'll never be satisfied  
And if I can't see you

When love goes wrong, only love knows why  
Life goes on for the lonely man

And there's a part of me with you

I was an iron man I had a master plan  
But I was alone  
  
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind  
I remember how your body started trembling  
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in  
I'm still alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
And all the wonders made for the earth  
And all the hearts in all creation  
Somehow I always end up alone  
  
Always end up alone, always end up alone  
So I'll play, I'll wait  
'Cause you know that love takes time  
  
Living love between the line  
We came (sha la) so close (so far)  
Just the beat of a lonely heart  
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone  
  
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone  
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home  
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere  
But I'm still alone  
  
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate  
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate  
Am I the subject of the pain  
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone  
  
And is there glory there to behold  
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told  
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la  
And I pray it's not too late  
We came sha la so far so far  
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine  
And I don't want to be alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gone but not out of sight  
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home  
I don't want to be alone face the heat of the the night  
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone  
You search for the light  
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean  
And clean out of sight I'm caught in the rain  
And there's no one home

39,"'leaving' that's all you ever seem to say and I'm tired  
The wants you have me for have expired  
Sleeping and reading every book I can find to get my mind off  
In all I was a soul you were using  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead  
  
People, the sun is going down on your heads so read your paper  
There's no one there for you to confide in  
It's instinct to always to have a shoulder to cry on  
And to rely on  
Someone there to share and to shine on  
I am alone again  
You can't believe the tears that I've shed  
I'm on a bound down train  
Don't desert me now or I am dead

40,"I've been here all your life watching your crying game  
You were the heaven in my lonely world  
And he was your sun and your rain  
I was losing you before I ever held you tight  
Before you ever held me in your arms  
And I won't make you blue  
And maybe an everlasting love will do  
  
Ah, we got an everlasting love  
So tall, so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
It's your love I need, it's the only show  
And it's you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday  
We killed the pain , we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Take me out of the cold  
Give me what I've hungered for  
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need  
Then it only makes me love you more  
I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine  
I could have saved you all the pain you knew  
And I won't make you cry  
And maybe an everlasting love can try  
  
Ah, we got an everlasting love  
So tall , so wide, so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
It's your love I need, it's the only show  
And it's you want an everlasting dream

Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place

Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...  
  
Your always talkin' right and talkin' about  
The world and it's corruption and moral decay  
But what you gonna do about it, nothing,  
'Cause you're more like children then children while they play  
Why you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands  
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you  
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do

You're so blown up with anger about the world  
You write the songs about  
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name  
Now you want to go the the moon and live there  
When you know it'll only end up the same  
How can he give you any gratitude,  
With your endless sickenin' attitude  
You strive to get ahead  
But you leave each other dead  
Can't you see, children laughin',  
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do  
So what's wrong with you, ah...

Though say I know it's only the weather.  
'Cause every time it rains you are gone.

Then I wake up, then I wake up.

And the trees will talk to the skies, whispering lies,  
Heaven will pass to me, yeah.  
Trains walk by and the birds disappear.  
Oh! Why am I still here without you by my side.  
So I cry your name and love,  
The thought to me is back and how near.

Is just a spotlight on an empty stage

Keeps burning on, keeps burning on

But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
  
Oh, one, two, three and now there's me  
You practice to deceive  
You lead me on, another one  
I've got no room to breathe  
  
So bye bye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind  
Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind  
Too many boys on your mind

60,"Many years have passed, it seems,  
And I am all alone.  
I've sent the children far away  
To some obscure unknown.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
It's so sad,  
So sad.  
Close another door.  
Listen to my eyes.  
Close another door.  
You're much too old to work,  
So won't you run away?  
  
When I was young, I used to say  
That age won't bother me.  
The life I had was very sad,  
It all went out to sea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And though the sun is in outside,  
The rain is in my hair.  
Now my life is lived inside,  
(Now all my life is mystified)  
My home is in my chair.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me go.  
Send me flowers and  
Put me on a plane.  
I've paid before,  
  
So I've been told  
At least I'm alive  
  
I may be old but I've been told at least I'm still alive  
Fly me young, fly, and tomorrow, yeah  
Get me up  
I been working so, so very hard

61,"I'm full of pride and my heart feels good  
Got news from my family up in the woods  
At last I can go back where I belong  
Sweated it all out for nine long years  
  
Couldn't believe the voice in my ears  
When the man saying ""no hiding ,son""  
So I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then, hardly grown  
  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far  
Said to myself stay right where you are  
Done found yourself a ma and pa  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everybody said the kid's no good  
Come home johnny bride come home  
Johnny bride come home  
We're all wrong without you  
How did we ever doubt you  
He confessed to the killing  
It's his role we had you filling  
We didn't really mean to make you sad  
But when you ran you made us think that you were twice as bad  
  
I left the only folks I had known  
I was fifteen then , hardly grown  
When they found me in the swamp face down in the mud  
  
Couldn't get back and I couldn't go far

62,"So warm is my morning sun, red is my rainbow  
Soft is the cool summer breeze when I saw your face  
I saw the light in your eyes so dark and demanding  
Like a light in the storm  
  
Whenever I cry my friend  
You're always away and so I pretend  
If I could live the dreams that I see  
Long live my love  
  
Walking in country (country) lanes (country lanes)  
I'll never belong to someone again  
Living my whole life through  
Long live my love for you

And all things seem clear to me now

Country women now, why don't you get out of this life  
Leave my life alone  
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter  
You came on like a river, doin' all the things you oughta  
You're a self made women, baby, not a made-to-order

64,"He smiled and rubbed the stubble on his chin  
He sure shall find the weariness and dreariness of life that's growing thin  
Yet, he didn't have so very far to go  
With a pencil in his hand he will travel on as planned  
With a mere step in the mountain to a light  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Even in the morning when he slept  
Something odd is missing  
There's nothing very much to talk about  
And nothing very much to see  
  
Craise Finton Kirk, see him go, on his way  
Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice  
  
Talks about the place he'd like to go  
And you never see the worrying and hurrying that makes a person slow  
Yet, you wouldn't think he'd be so hard to find  
Yet, he looks so very busy but there's nothing on his mind  
And his wavy hair continues not to grow

Oh, they don't know where he is  
Very very nice, very very nice

65,"There were the trees, see the grass, a thing gets inspired.  
Said ""This is the place I will try,"" and he did.  
Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in,  
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did.  
  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.  
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes,  
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise.  
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home.

All the kisses there are to be found.

Late December back in sixty-three.  
What a very special time for me.

Oh what a night!  
No I didn't even know her name,  
But I'm never gonna be the same.  
What a lady, what a night!  
  
Oh I, I had a funny feeling when she walked into the room.  
And I, as I recall it ended much too soon.  
Oh what a night!  
  
Hypnotized and mesmorizing me.  
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.  
Sweet surender, what a night!  
  
I felt the rush at the rolling balls of thunder.  
Spinning my head around and taking my body under,  
Oh what a night!  
  
Why'd it take so long to see the light.  
Seemed so wrong, but now it seemed so right.  
What a lady, what a night!

A little good luck, never stuck  
She got me climbing the walls  
Got me hard as a rock  
Within a city of sin, she got a city block  
And she was barkin' at the moon

So many sides to her

She can double it up  
And she's a way of life  
And whether dead or alive  
She got a fix on me  
And I was dancin' in the fire  
White steam, never seen  
In every muscle and bone  
She was a love machine  
And she could wrestle me down  
And get a taste of me  
In her web of desire  
  
She changed my world  
How can the body know  
It's touchin' me or her

72,"1974  
I was hungry and I was cold , had a father far too old  
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be  
In a tree trunk in the park , he was living in the dark  
Keeping other dogs like him for company  
  
In the evening I'd go down to a nightclub in the town  
Try to get some bread to make another way  
Back to the park I'd go , dig him out of the snow  
You know he's lived a thousand years day to day  
  
Well , the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end  
When I'm long dead and gone will your love for me go on  
Will I be the one you run to in the end  
And all my dogs need a friend  
  
It was a quarter to three in the summer of '73  
When I heard somebody call outside my door  
Said ""Are you friend or are you foe""  
He looked up and he said ""no, but I'd like to come inside and know you more""  
  
Well the days get shorter and the nights get longer  
And you never learn to know  
If you love one another , could you look at each other  
Could it ever really show  
And at this moment in time you couldn't make up your mind  
Now could you ever understand  
Are you following me just like Moses to the sea  
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end

Will I be the one you run to in the end

This happy room will be a lonely place when you are gone  
And I won't even have your shoulders for the crying on  
No other women's love could be as true, I'm begging you  
  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love  
  
We changed the world we made it ours to hold  
But dreams are made for those who really try  
This losing you is real  
But I still feel you here inside

Don't throw it all away, our love  
Don't throw it all away, our love, our love

I got an open mind  
And you've been thirsty for the friend you found

You with another and we all get satisfied

You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be commital to be a little deviation  
  
So I get all wound up inside  
I can see your scene unwind  
You dance together or you dance alone  
And leave the real world in the air  
Love it in leather I don't care  
Everything is legal in the danger zone  
  
Close your eyes and make a wish  
Later we could cater to the animal  
Knowing that you're mine  
It's straight in my face  
You and your lover and the brain is paralyzed

It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion

What is done can be undone  
You know we look for the same insane games  
Got to be committal  
To the subtle variations  
  
It's a form of evolution  
It's a kind of movin' on  
It's a cycle of emotion  
In being the one  
If your love is for the givin'  
It's a case of destiny  
And you can find your source of pleasure  
In being with me  
  
[Chorus]

82,"Fool in the night on the stair,  
With the light by the window.  
Out in the jungle of life she was  
Yearning to go.  
  
All of the years I've been there for the tears  
She will sell you.  
Out in the city she search for the face  
That she knew.  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Caroline,  
Fallen Angel.  
Caroline.  
Oh oh oh,  
Fallen Angel,  
I'm so lost,  
Tonight, lonely tonight.  
Lonely tonight.  
  
Fool is the father who clings to the  
Child he is losing.  
Mother too weary to question  
The wisdom of youth.  
  
There with your head in your handa  
As you pray to her picture.  
Out in the rain she would search  
For somebody to hold.  
  
Did you believe you could find  
What you need with a stranger?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Did you believe that a love so alive could be over?

83,"No matter how long it takes  
No mater how long  
No matter how long it takes  
Well never be alone  
Don't wanna make a wrong headline  
No matter how strong  
They'll be watching every move you make  
Don't let em know they can beat you  
  
Fortune favor the brave  
Learn how to use that muscle  
Take a little chance will get you  
Everything you see  
Living at the speed of light  
Gotta make your heart beat faster  
You gotta climb inside  
Set that spirit free  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
Stumble on the ground that shakes you  
Push it to the point that breaks you  
Little bit of fire it gives you  
Soul of a winner  
Help you bring them to their knees  
  
In the face of the foe  
Never let em drag you under  
Don't you wanna leave behind ya  
A legacy  
Catch another streak of lightning  
By the God of fire and thunder  
Battle in the name of the nation  
Making history  
  
Fight the good fight  
Fingers to the bone  
Gotta take a stand  
And save this land of liberty  
And brother when you're down to zero  
Everybody needs that hero  
Gotta be a star to follow  
All the way there  
And all the way home

84,"When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
We used to love while others used to play.  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we are tall, and Christmas trees are small,  
And you don't ask the time of day.  
But you and I, our love will never die,  
But guess we'll cry come first of May.  
  
The apple tree that grew for you and me,  
I watched the apples falling one by one.  
And I recall the moment of them all,  
The day I kissed your cheek and you were mine.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall,  
Do do do do do do do do do,  
Don't ask me why, but time has passed us by,  
Some one else moved in from far away.

85,"I'm not that someone who's got what you want.  
I can do nothing but watch what you do.  
You just want someone to kiss you good night,  
But lips are never enough to get you through.  
You stole my nights and you got your way,  
Now you got me dying inside, oh baby.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say.  
Pick up the pieces of my life  
Into the night of day.  
  
How do you break this heart of steel.  
Nobody ever could.  
Open the pages of my life.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
I'll be your saviour but baby I swear  
I'm not living my life over you.  
Some satisfaction you get if you dare  
But is it ever enough to get you through?  
You stole my mind and you watch me fall.  
Now you leave the scene of the crime, oh no.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
I'm only flesh and blood.  
  
When you're gone,  
You'll be leaving behind  
A broken man with something to hide.  
Oh, lost in the night in a town without pity,  
You learn how to cry, you learn how to cry.  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
Listen to what I say (ooh),  
Pick up the pieces of my life into the night of day (ooh).  
How do you break this heart of steel?  
Nobody ever could (ooh).  
Open the pages of my life,  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Gone are the days that came and went.  
Houses are made of wood (ooh).  
Live in a world of sand and stone.  
I'm only flesh and blood (ooh).  
  
Ebony, don't walk out on me.  
I never thought you could.  
I'm only what you make of me.

"
86,"I stumble in the night  
Never really knew what it would've been like  
You're no longer there to break my fall  
The heartache over you  
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through  
I never saw the signs  
You're the last to know when love is blind  
  
All the tears and the turbulent years  
When I would not wait for no-one  
Didn't stop and take a look at myself  
And see me losing you  
  
[Chorus:]  
When the lonely heart breaks  
It's the one that forsakes  
It's the dream that we stole  
And I'm missing you more  
Than the fire that will roar  
There's a hole in my soul  
For you it's goodbye  
For me it's to cry  
For whom the bell tolls  
  
Seen you in a magazine  
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been  
Hanging on the arm of someone else  
I'm still in love with you  
Won't you come back to your little boy blue  
I've come to feel inside  
This precious love was never mine  
  
Now I know but a little too late  
That I could not live without you  
In the dark or the broad daylight  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I know there'll be times like this  
When I couldn't reach out to no-one  
Am I never gonna find someone  
Who knows me like you do  
Are you leaving me a helpless child  
When it took so long to save me  
Fight the devil and the deep blue sea  
I'll follow you anywhere  
I promise I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]

87,"Hush my darling , sleep my lover  
There'll be rain till we run for cover  
Lost in love in a world of strangers  
Something only the lord arranges  
Oh my darling , now I found you  
Want to live all my life around you  
You're my light in a world of sorrow  
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow  
I just want to hold you forever , forever  
Loving one another that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me  
Oh my darling , if you leave me  
I lose the love that has always freed me  
Not knowing angel , what's coming after  
Never hearing you're golden laughter  
Oh my baby , hearts like thunder  
Can't escape from the spell I'm under  
I surrender to all your treasure  
Endless nights of pain and pleasure  
I just want to hold you , forever , forever  
Loving one another , that's how it should be  
Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me

Needing you beside me , together , no never  
Try to rediscover no other but me

88,"On a hill, inside a house in Covewell Reach  
Stands a man who's feeling very tired  
Looking at a song he wrote some time ago  
Could have made it big inside a Broadway show  
  
Every day I go away and find ideas  
Think I'll climb on top of somewhere high  
Couldn't I write a song about a man who's dead?  
Didn't really know if he was off his head  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Sitting in his attic on a sunny day  
Mending fifty goblets that are worn  
Humming to himself a song of yesteryear  
His hearing wasn't good but his eyes were clear  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
We can tell the world that he was right  
  
Now the house is burnt, along with Gilbert Green  
Sad to see his sisters stand and cry  
And in the basement lies a song that wasn't seen  
Tells the tale of laughing men and yellow beans  
  
Ev'rybody knows, that's the way it goes  
Too bad for Gilbert Green  
Now we can tell the world that he was right

And i leave 'cause i can't stay

You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me  
I remember yesterday , turn my tears to laugher  
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after  
  
I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying  
I remember all the words you were softly saying  
  
Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane  
It's ours , my love , until the day we say auf wiedersehen

Maybe I can't survive in the danger zone.  
Sounds of the night.  
Streets without light.

Oh  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker  
Is it a lesson that I never knew?  
Suddenly everything I ever wanted  
My love for you, ooh  
  
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

101,"Well, this is my last connection , I been slowing up the line.  
Ain't no satisfaction in this troubled head of mine.  
Gotta get back to the highway , gonna get back to where I know.  
'cause sooner or later there's gonna be a showdown ,  
Gotta go man, gotta go.  
  
Hell, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Ain't nobody's sweetheart, ain't nobody's fool.  
And if the sun don't set on my house babe,  
I'd be the last man to blow my cool.  
I feel my body shake.  
Well, there's so much left to say.  
Spend my life anticipatin'.  
Gonna find a way.  
  
Hey, I'm so so tired , so so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
So so tired.  
So so tired.  
And I don't know where I'm gonna start.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
Only heavy breathing in the dark.  
It's only heavy breathing in the dark.  
  
Well, I don't believe in ev'rything you say just to save my soul.  
You know there's got to be a way better than a big black hole.  
Gotta take me from my suicide.  
Now you know it's love I crave.  
You know we got to live like this from the cradle to the grave.  
  
So so so so tired.  
So so so so tired.  
I'm so so so so tired.

102,"I was stood by the light as I looked through the window

I was there in the dark and I saw you together  
You were up in his arms , I was down on my knees

No need to pretend  
You've got to be cruel to be kind  
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay 'cause  
  
He's a liar  
He's a liar and I should know liar  
He's a liar and I should know - ahhh  
  
Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember  
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet  
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather  
I was through the window and down in the street  
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive  
And it's not how I want it to be  
There's a hand on my shoulder  
He said I'll survive ,but-  
  
He's a liar  
He's a liar, and I should know liar  
He's a liar,and I should know-ahhh

Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive  
Was it not for the red limousine  
I'd be millions of miles from th scene of the crime  
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine -but

103,"You got to walk a little slower when you're with her  
Take the time to be tender, that's the plan  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
You got to live for every moment that she gives you  
Make the one in a million understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand  
  
Now too many faces have come down between us  
And I was the fool to be  
And I can't deny you the wide open spaces  
As long as she stops loving me  
  
You got to stand a little closer when you hold her  
Make her feel like a woman , understand  
You got to stand a little taller while her world falls to pieces  
Only then can you hold her in your hand

Don't believe that it's all the same  
Can't think what I've just said

Yet why am I so blind  
When the someone else is me  
It's unkind, it's unkind

And feeling moments of swimming in cream

Hours of facing my life, have damned  
  
You are a good friend

Your father wants you to live on his knee

Something good in giving in.  
How do I get through to you?  
You must be made of stone.  
  
Just when I was safe and sound.  
Love, you built a wall around.  
You take a hard line attitude.  
Time to send me back to school.  
Or take me, take me to your

Easy on your body when you got no name.

You can knock on any door.  
I know what I'm looking for.  
Red light, hit and run.  
Time to turn the engine on.

You got me infatuated,  
Good love is not for sale,  
I nearly gave myself away.

108,"I can think of younger days when living for my life  
Was everything a man could want to do  
I could never see tomorrow,  
But I was never told about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?  
What makes the world go round?  
How can you mend this broken man?  
How can a loser ever win?  
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again  
  
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  
And misty memories of days gone by  
We could never see tomorrow,  
No one said a word about the sorrow  
  
And how can you mend a broken heart?  
How can you stop the rain from falling down?  
How can you stop the sun from shining?

Knowing what I came here for  
Get a little of your womanifestation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it grow  
We can draw the line on where we  
Let the fingers go  
  
Now I know me  
Never wanna lose control  
Making me the subject  
Of your warm initiation  
If I can pinpoint this feeling  
When you gonna let it show  
You make me nervous but it's now or never  
  
Oh Oh  
You can be my message from above  
And it's time to say you're sorry  
We can sanctify our love  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the wind  
You can't just go movin' out  
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in

I want to be your lover  
I want to be your human sacrifice  
I want to be your lover

Maybe undergo a lover's operation  
Nothing cuts like a knife can  
You don't wanna hurt me more  
Look at all that damage  
We could do together  
  
Oh no  
You can wear me closer to the bone  
It don't work to make me worry  
But the demon seed is sown  
  
Oh no  
And you and I we're written in the sky  
You can't make me hold on  
Better you shoot my love between the eyes  
  
Your eyes on me on this table where I lie  
And what I see as fact is fiction  
You won't let me die  
And I'm bound to be abused  
I won't let you cut me loose  
This love is out to get you  
When the blood begins to flow

113,"True love is one thing I've been dreaming of  
I give my soul to you and when I do  
You are to me, the very deepest part of me  
In the darkness, is you that always shows the way  
The very air I breathe  
When hope is gone  
You give me all the strength I need to carry on  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
When you hurt me, then I become the night time  
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good  
It shows this heart is not made of wood  
When you stay with me then I can feel the sunlight  
The love light fills my eyes  
And through the tears I feel my fears just melt away  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky  
I am the sea  
I'm anything that you want me to be  
  
I am the world  
I am the sky

Can't imagine how you came to think of those  
That same colour rose, for me  
My world is made up of memories  
You and I, the laughter and tears  
You never need to worry  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
I remember all the good things  
When you held me for the first time  
Things were right  
On that rainy night, for us  
Love, then, now and forever  
No time real and right where we are  
As good as my eyes can be  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be some many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
  
No one ever cried  
No one ever stood in the way  
Ev'rybody lies  
Ev'rybody buys what love is today  
You can be a fool  
In the beginning, baby you were there  
And when you're winning  
What do you do  
Don't ask me  
  
I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others  
But I can't see anything  
See anything but you  
There could be so many others but...

Can't you see I'm not the guy  
That I pretend to be.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.  
  
The more I try the more I fail,  
I'd like to run away.  
But if I try you pass me by,  
I know that I can't stay.  
Though I know I will be lonely  
But our love will never die  
I close my eyes, everyday, I close my eyes.

No more hide and seek.  
You are the highest dream to me.

then I can tell you what it means.  
  
Locked in my arms like lovers lie,  
I will not let you slip away.  
Is this the summer of them all.  
Is this my night of nights  
that you came to stay.  
  
Here you are, owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,  
if you promise to believe

Seasons may come and seasons go  
but these are the truest words I know.  
Face to face, eye to eye.  
This is the summer of of our lives.  
One love that cannot die.  
  
Here you are, owner of my soul,  
never let you say goodbye.  
And there is something I must say to you,  
we leave the world outside  
and you have come to me at last, we start.  
  
Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside.  
I'm only doing what I have to do.  
If you promise to believe  
that I could not love you more.  
  
Here you are (you are), owner of my heart,  
just the way that love should be.  
And there's something I must say to you,

Open up your heart,  
let my deepest love inside (ah).  
I'm only doing what I have to do.

that it's you I'm living for

There ain't no space back there

With the love forever with me  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul  
That's the only thing that satisfies my soul

I don't want to be the one  
Remember it was only fun  
Two strangers touching in the sun, it had to end

Strangely I was upset  
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached saying

Don't try to take on the world""  
  
Made up my bed and decided to sleep  
Dreaming I was awake  
Maybe I drank an excess of my drink  
Nice clan, cordial crowd  
Birkworth suggested we sleep through the night  
I never knew him so well

I don't want to die of hunger  
I got my world created for you  
But you don't stay  
Not my imagination no more  
I can't be dealing with the bad girl  
Lives in your head  
You got your someone I , don't cry  
You go and take a strangers love instead  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
You know I love the way you do it  
When you do it right  
You ain't no one man woman  
Were you ever  
If you don't come back running  
When you've had enough  
And baby , you got it , I want it  
Show me what's left of your love  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
  
I won't be no dirty weekend  
I stay with you for good  
He can be your outside lover  
I've got eyes  
I know he's in your blood  
Just let me hold you for the hour  
I go where you lead me  
I need some inspiration from you  
I'm ready for the mystery , take me  
Don't let me fall  
Don't let me drown down here in the rain  
There is no alibi , don't lie  
You love a stranger and the world is pain  
  
Over you is where I should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Under me is where you should be  
I could be loving you too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)  
Too much, too much ( come a little bit closer)

124,"I started a joke which started the whole world crying  
But I didn't see that the joke was on me oh no  
I started to cry which started the whole world laughing  
Oh If I'd only seen that the joke was on me  
  
I looked at the skies running my hands over my eyes  
And I fell out of bed hurting my head from things that I said  
'Till I finally died which started the whole world living

Thieves in the dark, you ought to be locked in chains

Love that lasts forever,

We are elite, prisoners of the night.  
We fight to the finish and savour the delights.  
It's your body that got me beat, and I'm crumbling at your feet,  
I surrender (I surrender), I surrender.

I will walk through fire to keep you safe and sound (oh no, oh no).  
In the final hour, turn my life around (oh no),

It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game  
  
I had a billion or two in the bank  
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks  
You gave me all that a woman could give  
Less you're affection, I don't want to live

It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

128,"Is this your voice I heard  
Speakin' my name

Talkin' to myself and believin'  
I could live without you  
Livin' on the lies and beleivin' that

Listen to me please and I'm beggin' on

But you don't show me the way  
No you don't show me the way  
  
He may change you're world and someday  
He may break your heart  
And you deserve no better  
If you love him I will step aside  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will  
You know I will  
  
So this is who you are  
And the rest of my life  
I dedicate to you  
And I know that love can't wait  
There's a moon and a sun  
And a dream that sees me through  
  
A little bit of change and  
A little bit of my desire  
I was shakin' all over and  
I didn't know what to say  
I'm the man in the middle and  
The middle man catches fire  
But I don't know how to go away  
No I don't know how to go away  
  
He became your hero somehow  
I became your clown  
And you deserve no better but my love  
Is here and all I found  
I offer this to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't take your heart  
You know I will  
  
It ain't wise  
It ain't smart  
You say there's no doubt about it  
If you decide  
You got somebody else  
When I want you to myself  
I can't stop  
I can't look  
I can't say no more about it  
But my love will go on  
Just as long as the river flows  
  
He will be your king but someday  
He may let you down  
Follow to the letter that my love is  
Real and what I found  
I offer it to you  
So leave me as I love you still  
And if he don't keep you warm  
You know I will

129,"(Kenny Rogers On Vocals)  
  
I saw you tonight  
In the room where love had started once before.  
And we opened up the skies.  
With your loving eyes  
You take me back where you belong in my heart.  
  
One love frozen in time.  
Never be a bad love.  
Yours and mine.  
But I still remain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you.  
And then being close to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
You are inside of me.  
One more time.  
Don't you remember me.  
And the days that lie ahead  
May all go wrong.  
  
But tonight, my love,  
There's no question in my mind where we should be.  
It's clear that you're alone and I'm alone.  
And all the fools have gone.  
You open up so tears can fall from your eyes.  
  
True love can never die.  
We can make it one day, if we try.  
Be there, sunshine or rain.  
I will never change.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
  
Your hand in mine.  
I got a memory  
For all time.  
Don't you remember me.  
Now my dream will come true  
If you love me.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.  
  
I will always love you.  
I will always take your part.  
And all the years of losing you and then  
Making love to you again.  
The very chance that I could take your heart.  
Your hand in mine.

130,"I been thinking sitting on a pole.  
I'm getting sick of doing what I'm told.  
Just me and the mirror and my brain.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
  
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground.  
I couldn't feel any noise or hear any sound.  
Fifteen million years I spent down the line.  
But that was when I got an idea.  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear.  
Don't you think it's time you got up and stood alone?  
Get up and stand alone  
  
That was when I got an idea.

Are a waste of time

Why, tell me why I made her cry

A hero with a medal for everyday.

I keep on pushing never stop.

I'll kiss your memory

I'll kiss your memory  
  
I'll kiss the thoughts of leaves that fell when summer was over  
And I'll cherish all the thoughts you gave to me  
And I will wander through the darkness  
I'll keep crying one last tear  
Now your lips are gone  
I'll kiss your memory

Symbol of my faith in who I am,  
But you are my only.  
  
And I must follow on the road that lies ahead.  
And I won't let my heart control my head.  
But you are my only.

Is there within the child?  
My storm will never end.  
My fate is on the wind.  
The king of hearts, the joker's wild.  
  
But we don't say goodbye.  
We don't say goodbye.  
I'll make them all remember me.  
  
'cause I have found a dream that must come true.  
Every ounce of me must see it through.  
You are my only.  
  
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play.  
Hand over my heart I'll find my way.  
I will make them give to me..(yeah)  
  
Immortality.(oh baby)  
There is a vision and a fire in me.(oh)  
I keep the memory of you and me, inside.

Building castles in the shifting sands  
In a world that no one understands,  
In the morning.

In the morning of my life the  
Minutes take so long to drift away  
Please be patient with your life  
It's only morning and you're still to live your day  
In the evening I will fly you to the moon  
To the top right hand corner of  
The ceiling in my room  
  
Where I'll stay until the sun shines  
Another day to swing on clothes lines  
May I be yawning

But she went back down the river  
Just when I thought I could be strong

Ring of fire in the days of old

Search me North, East, South, or West  
It's all I miss, just the one last kiss  
  
This is goodbye to the days (of our lives)

How far can you go?  
The rolling of thunder and,  
You decide what you're after

Play no games , he'd say to me  
We know who is wrong  
So please don't make no hesitation  
There will be no recriation  
  
Jumbo said to say goodnight  
He's a friend of yours  
Listen you can chew it  
If it's loud enough you can hear it  
  
'Cause it's narrow as a sparrow  
And it shoots a bow and arrow  
Thro'a top that's made with  
Powder with a gun it's even louder  
  
And it's shattering to hear  
Yuo mustn't listen with your ear  
But it gets to you  
Yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes ! yes !

144,"Babe  
It seems every night and day, I get to lose  
And I always held the faith inside  
That love would find a way  
And I always reached for more  
Than the others ever saw  
  
I was always the first to follow  
My foolish prayer  
And the feelings that I have are more than  
Any soul can bare  
  
Only when I wake  
Then I can be sure of who I am  
I'm half the man I should be  
When you're gone and you're telling me  
  
This is love but just in case  
I keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Right here or out in space  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case, just in case.  
  
Tell the world that I come to claim  
Your tomorrows  
Let the universal word go out  
A million miles away  
And history has shown  
that when the seed is sown  
We are livig in a time when the tears fall  
Where they might  
But we hear each other much more than those who  
See  
We are not alone  
Love is there for everyone who needs  
And for anyone who cries  
And I will alaways have you here with me  
  
And you're telling me  
This is love, but just in case  
Keep my heart in a secret place  
Safe under lock and key  
'Til I know it's only me  
One of us got to be the one that's true  
One for the other and the love comes through  
Yours,mine and face to face  
Give my heart to you,babe  
But just in case

It's not the eye alone that gives you sight.  
I've never given anybody my soul,

Imitations,  
Existing out of time.

You say it's nothing but it's everything.

To be in love in such a lonely way

I cannot fall in love with everyone  
So I must choose between the two

Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning.  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine

Under the lamp in our old avenue.

And you can understand  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah,yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan.  
No one to show me the signs.  
I'm just a creature of habit  
In a complicated world.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide  
  
I'm just the man in the middle  
Of a complicated plan  
No one to show me the light.  
Ah, yes, I'm weary from battle  
But I've just begun to fight.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man in the middle.  
The only man.  
The fool of a man in the middle.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
I'm just the man.  
The only man.  
That stupid man.  
Nowhere to run to.  
Nowhere to hide, to hide, to hide

"
164,"[Chorus]  
I'm a man on fire  
It's a burning thing  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby  
I'm a man on fire  
An eternal flame  
It'll burn on forever  
If you feed me baby, oh  
  
Gotta be a place to go in the midnight hour  
Heart of a woman and just a little bit of pulling power  
The feeling's got me  
I don't know what it means  
I know it must be wrong  
But when you love somebody you dream, and I dream  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there, and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong in love  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can be  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ready when the lightning strikes and he deed is done  
I'm not a beginner  
But I'm a sinner when the heat is on  
Nothing gonna stop me, got me all that you need  
Woman, when you need somebody  
A woman with a face and a body, you dream, and I dream  
  
I save the love down deep inside me for the moment when you come  
And you're there and you're gone  
And I'm alive for you  
And my love keeps hanging on  
  
There is no life  
No reason to go on believing in the stronger love  
There is no unifying, if I don't hear you crying  
I'm yours, you're mine, no power in the world  
Together we are strong enough  
And when your storm is over, I'll show how warm my love can me  
And me, I'm a man on fire  
  
[Chorus]

165,"Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,  
Something's telling me I must go home.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
The day I left her standing on her own.  
  
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,  
Gotta do the things I wanna do.  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
They brought me back to see my way with you.  
  
Talk about the life in Massachusetts,  
Speak about the people I have seen,  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.  
  
I will remember Massachusetts

166,"Who is the girl with the crying face looking at millions of signs?  
She knows that life is a running race,  
Her face shouldn't show any line.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair, remember you're only a girl.  
  
Who is the girl at the window pane,  
Watching the rain falling down?  
Melody, life isn't like the rain  
Its just like a merry go round.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a girl.  
  
Who is the girl with the crying face,  
Looking at millions of signs?  
She knows that life is a running race.  
Her face shouldn't show any lines.  
  
Melody Fair won't you comb your hair?  
You can be beautiful too.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a woman.  
Melody Fair,  
Remember you're only a girl.

167,"I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know myself  
  
I've seen the lights of every city  
Tried to work out where I am  
I close my mind for the day  
I know the way  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes  
I'm on the shelf  
I know my self  
  
There's never ever anybody to rely on  
There isn't time to count the shoulders I have cried on  
That's just circumstances , I must take my chances  
But, baby you don't know what I'm saying  
But I guess that's not true  
And you know that's true  
But there's a method to my madness  
  
I've played the game , still it's not worth it  
Like a woman in the rain  
So I close my eyes for the day  
I know the way

"
168,"Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together, you and I.  
And all the bad is blown away.  
I never said goodbye.  
  
Is the writing on the wall  
That makes you see.  
And it's the saviour of my soul.  
And what I say that must be heard  
With love in every word.  
  
Close your eyes, don't let go,  
Don't get lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone you're not sure of.  
  
Broken wings don't arrive.  
It's a storm but you still survive.  
  
It's gonna take a miracle.  
  
So I go around believing you.  
I say good night, stay forever and  
Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night.  
And miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for.  
You were there and I was born,  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall,  
Tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen,  
You know miracles happen.  
  
Red, blue, black and white.  
True light shine on anyone.  
Two hearts make it right.  
And all that love can change.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow.  
Always out of place alone,  
With someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
And through it all we rise and fall.  
We tear it apart and stay forever.  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen.  
  
Hold on tight, call my name,  
Don't get caught in the midnight rain.  
Part of me believes in you,  
You're someone I'm not sure of.  
  
Don't look down, I'll be there,  
Like the wind in the cold night air.  
I can see a miracle.  
  
Close my eyes, don't let go.  
I'll be lost in the falling snow

169,"Girl, I've known you very well  
I've seen you growing every day  
I never really looked before  
But now you take my breath away  
  
Suddenly you're in my life  
A part of everything I do  
You got me workin' day and night  
Just tryin' to keep a hold on you  
  
Here in your arms I found my paradise  
My only chance for happiness  
And if I lose you now, I think I would die  
Say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
There are stories old and true  
Of people so in love like you and me  
And I can see myself  
Let history repeat itself  
  
Reflecting how I feel for you  
And thinking about those people then  
I know that in a thousand years  
I'd fall in love with you again  
  
This is the only way that we should fly  
This is the only way to go  
And if I lose your love, I know I would die  
Oh say you'll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman
