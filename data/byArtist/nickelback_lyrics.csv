0,"Let's meet in the city where  
The rivers cross bridges there  
Let's float down into the stream  
Of rich and poor pioneers  
A kid from a western town  
Wants to be seen and go out  
Let's borrow my parent's car  
Let's stay out all night up there  
And Burnside will be our street  
Where the kids and the hookers meet  
Diners and strip club junk  
Bookstores and punk rock clubs  
Water, Building and Sin  
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)  
Big Oregon city draws you in  
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)  
A promise fulfilled or not  
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)  
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot  
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)  
We'll make our home water-tight  
Work all day, play all night  
And hope we're not washed away  
By deceit or tragedy  
And Joan of Arc rules Northeast  
Where the poor and the hipsters meet  
The grid that divides us all  
The river makes final call  
Out at the edge of town  
Where airfield runs water down  
Coyote crosses the tracks  
And hops on the Light-Rail Max  
Water, Building and Sin  
(I'm as green as this blade in the grass that bends)  
Big Oregon city draws you in  
(In the wind that blows on the long weekends)  
A promise fulfilled or not  
(Where I take the bridge to the water fountains)  
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot  
(And to gain the hope that the city brings)  
And if you wanna be a friend of mine  
Cross the river to the east side  
Find me on the eve of suicide  
Tell me the city is no place to hide  
Take me out into a sunny day  
Through the grotto or the promenade  
You came to me in the nick of time  
Thankful for the things I left behind  
Oh dirty river, come let me in (3X)  
Oh dirty river

1,"I, I'm driving black on black  
Just got my license back  
I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track  
I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride  
Because the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight  
I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out  
I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run  
Your mom don't know that you were missing  
She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing  
Screamin'  
  
[Chorus]  
No, we're never gonna quit  
Ain't nothing wrong with it  
Just acting like we're animals  
No, no matter where we go  
Cause everybody knows  
We're just a couple of animals  
  
So come on baby, get in  
Get in, just get in  
Check out the trouble we're in  
  
You're beside me on the seat  
Got your hand between my knees  
And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze  
It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear  
But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears  
By now, no doubt that we were heading south  
I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth  
Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch  
It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch  
I'm screamin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on baby, get in  
Get in, just get in  
Look at the trouble we're in  
  
We were parked out by the tracks  
We're sitting in the back  
And we just started getting busy  
When she whispered ""what was that?""  
The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are  
And that was when she started screamin'  
""That's my dad outside the car!""  
Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition  
Must have wound up on the floor while  
we were switching our positions  
I guess they knew that she was missing  
As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing  
Screamin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So come on baby, get in  
We're just a couple of animals  
Get in, just get in  
Ain't nothing wrong with it  
Check out the trouble we're in  
Get in, just get in

It's true, I've said enough and so have you  
Just drive, you slam the door and so do I  
Tongue tied from all the little things  
And they're the reason that I scream  
  
I needed you  
Probably as bad as I need another hole in the head  
'Cause I needed you  
Car keys in your hand I believe that you would leave me for dead  
  
Your turn, you'd rather leave than live and learn  
That's why, you want an end and so do I

Well, I'll walk you home when the whole things done.  
If you're there, I don't even care which team won.  
  
We could stop at the coffee shop.  
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot.  
We could laugh as we both pretend that we're not in love and that we're just
good friends.  
  
Well, I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending.  
I know if not for you there's nothing I could do, to ever let it end.  
And I know you feel the same way, because you told me drunk on your birthday.

You never know where life's gonna go, because we're the only ones who will

About Sunday night, just her and I.  
Sitting side by side in the full moon light.  
I pulled her close just to hold her tight and the both of us could tell it
just felt right.  
She looked at me in the sweetest way.  
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say.  
Must have took a while to find the words 'cause she cut me off and finally
said it first.  
  
Well, I'm tired of pretending, but I'm terrified of it ending.

'Cause something's gotta go wrong  
'Cause I'm feelin' way too damn good  
  
Feelin' way too damn good  
  
I missed you so much that I begged here to fly here and see me  
  
Feelin' way too damn good  
  
I missed you so much that I begged here to fly here and see me

"
12,"Well, I wanted you  
I wanted no one else  
I thought it through  
I got you to myself  
You got off  
Every time you got onto me  
I got caught up  
In favorable slavery  
  
[Chorus]  
I guess it wasn't really right  
I guess it wasn't meant to be  
It didn't matter what they said  
Cause we were good in bed  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
No, it didn't matter what I tried  
It's just a little hard to leave  
When you're going down on me  
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight  
For all the wrong reasons  
  
Well, you know my friends  
They know your enemies  
And I'd pretend  
Not to hear what they said to me  
Cause I got off  
Every time you got onto me  
Was it wrong  
To go along with insanity?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away  
I guess it wasn't what, it wasn't really what I thought  
I thought it was the day I got, I want it all to go away

13,"I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt that's on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me  
You're like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I love the places that we go  
And I love the people that you know  
And I love the way you can't say ""No"" too many long lines in a row  
I love the powder on your nose

Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And now I know who you are

Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
I like the freckles on your chest  
And I like the way you like me best  
And I like the way you're not impressed, while you put me to the test  
  
I like the white stains on your dress  
And I love the way you pass the check  
And I love the good times that you wreck (The good times that you wreck)  
  
And I love your lack of self respect  
While you're passed out on the deck  
I love my hands around your neck  
  
Ouh and I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
  
And I know who you are  
It wasn't that hard  
Just to figure you out  
Now I did, you wonder why  
Why not before, you never tried  
Gone for good, and this is it  
  
I like your pants around your feet  
And I like the dirt that's on your knees  
And I like the way you still say please, while you're looking up at me  
You're like my favorite damn disease  
  
And I hate the places that we go  
And I hate the people that you know  
And I hate the way you can't say ""No"" too many long lines in a row

14,"Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the know-it-all  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Like I need to defend my own innocence  
So what, I did it, I admit it, and I'm pleading the fifth  
One more anthem for the know-it-all  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
Learn how to crawl  
  
In ten minutes I'll be laying out flat on the floor  
  
Eight minutes, I'm losin' it a little bit  
Five minutes, your description might be starting to fit  
Three to go and I'm forgetting all that I've ever known  
I won't be standing up for long, I'd better learn how to crawl  
  
Not like I need to depend upon anyone  
Since I can see the lack of need for me to be here at all  
One more anthem for the know-it-all

Where do bad men go when they die?  
And mother says you'll go there but  
Wings for her and I and I don't mind

If I take this, am I going to die?  
And he says no, so then I figure what the hell  
I'll try cause it's my life  
So light the match and you and I will...  
  
Fly...learn to  
Fly...learn to  
Fly...learn to  
Fly...  
  
'Cause I'm on my hands and knees I've crawled eternity to beg forgiveness  
And someday I'll be there I swear to you, God, as my witness  
For all the trusts I've broke and, let justice know, it's just that easy  
'Cause I'm a liar, I conspired, I'm a liar...  
  
And father tell your son  
It's not your gun and bloody hands  
Don't hide behind locked doors  
In dresser drawers those bullets wait to fly...  
  
Fly...wait to  
Fly...wait to  
Fly... wait to  
Fly...  
  
'Cause I'm on my hands and knees  
I've crawled eternity to beg forgiveness  
And someday I'll be there I swear to you

16,"[Verse 1]  
Wake up  
My baby still looks amazing with no make-up  
Damn it I knew the second that you came up  
From underneath the covers  
Said ""I wanna meet your mother, your daddy, your sister and your brother""  
One week, the time it took you to tell me that you love me  
Packed all of my shit and moved across the country  
And now we're buying diamonds  
Saying it's only 20 karats it can't be that hard to find it, baby

Your touch has made me a believer  
Your love is all I ever needed  
And she's the only one I'd follow for eternity

Light on sunset  
Can't imagine that you ain't having fun yet  
Baby maybe just wait cause I ain't drunk yet  
As soon as I looked over  
Yeah the waiter sugarcoated  
You were busy motorboatin' on that blonde girl  
What you doing nothing wrong girl  
Looks like we got another come along girl  
If you ain't afraid to try it  
You know we'll be flying private long as I can be the pilot baby

What a perfect misses, momma she still eat McDonald's  
Taste delicious scream Madonna knock this swiss so I guess she did it  
What, my kisses?

Hoping she pops back pays a visit  
To my baby yeah, my baby girl  
Run around town on a treadmill  
I ain't going nowhere, no wonder where  
That's what she wear  
Gotta playmate when I join the party

17,"I went out on the town with a friend last weekend.  
His ex girlfriend's friend was there alone.  
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling, she could really handle
alcohol.  
  
Another one down and headed off the deep end.  
The more we drank, the less that we had on.  
  
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.  
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.  
She's got a fast car, hotter than a dance bar.  
Looking like a rock star, she'll be the talk of the town.  
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
Gotta get me some.  
  
God all mighty look at that body.  
Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari.  
She's a scene from a Baywatch rerun.  
Hotter then a barrel on a squeeze machine gun.  
  
Well, she can get it lower then a Maserati.  
Never seen somebody move that way.  
Everywhere she goes there's an instant party.  
Everybody wants to know her name.  
  
And it turns out she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.  
She smokes a little home grown, drinks a little Cuervo.  
Still a little down home, there was never a doubt.  
She's got a fast car, hotter then a dance bar.  
Looking like a rock star, and she likes to go out and  
  
She likes to get her hands up.  
Anything to stand on.  
Anything to dance on.  
She'd be swinging around.  
Under the hot lights, underneath the spot light.  
Keep it going all night.  
She'll be the talk of the town.  
  
You know, she's got everything I want, but all rolled into one.

Save yourselves, your family  
Don't worry 'bout the rest

The human mile, they're never coming back  
Hold out your hand and ask for some  
Now and again she sits beneath the tree  
The sign above reads  
Hard work will set you free  
Hold out your hand and ask for some  
Too late for another direction  
Always what we've got in store  
Hurry back we've all been waiting

A childless mother  
Leave it except for one

There ain't enough to keep me here too long

Just enough to keep me bouncing off the wall, yeah

Pills and all, enough to kill him while he sleeps  
Is this the alley we dragged him to  
Just off of Hollywood and Normandy  
  
It didn't work like she said it would  
Just like livin' in Hollywood  
Just like a bad dream, or so it seems  
Just like I'm back in emergency

Singing Amen, I'm alive

Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive  
Amen I, Amen I, Amen I, I'm alive  
  
And in the air the fireflies  
Our only light in paradise

We realize how small we are  
If they could love like you and me  
Imagine what the world could be  
  
If everyone cared and nobody cried  
If everyone loved and nobody lied

22,"My best friend gave me the best advice  
He said each day's a gift and not a given right  
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind  
And try to take the path less traveled by  
That first step you take is the longest stride  
  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?  
Would you live each moment like your last?  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?  
If today was your last day  
(If today was your last day)  
  
Against the grain should be a way of life  
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight  
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try  
So live like you'll never live it twice  
Don't take the free ride in your own life  
  
[Chorus]  
If today was your last day  
And tomorrow was too late  
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?  
Would you live each moment like your last?  
Leave old pictures in the past  
Donate every dime you have?  
Would you call old friends you never see?  
Reminisce old memories  
Would you forgive your enemies?  
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?  
Swear up and down to God above  
That you finally fall in love  
If today was your last day  
  
If today was your last day  
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?  
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars  
Regardless of who you are  
So do whatever it takes  
Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life  
Let nothin' stand in your way  
Cause the hands of time are never on your side  
  
[Chorus]

Just for hurting you  
And I want to break his mind down

25,"He was my best friend, I tried to help him,  
But he traded everything, for suffering,  
And found himself alone.  
I watched the lying, turn into hiding,  
With scars on both his lips, his fingertips,  
Were melted to the bone.

But I can still remember what his face looked like,  
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night.  
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!  
Tell me what you know! Tell me what you gone and done now!  
Gun would do the trick, get it over with,  
You're better off,  
To take all you've got and burn it on the spot,  
Just to get high,(high)  
  
Three days no sleeping, he gave up eating,  
He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing,  
And pretended not to know,  
He started stealing, to supply the feeling,  
Found out he pulled a knife, on someone's wife,  
And held it to her throat.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what did, where you gone and hid?  
Show me!  
What you really want, was it what you got?  
Slowly!

So just close your eyes  
Well honey here comes a lullaby  
Your very own lullaby  
  
Well everybody's hit the bottom  
And everybody's been forgotten  
Well everybody's tired of being alone  
Yeah everybody's been abandoned  
And left a little empty handed  
So if you're out there barely hangin', on  
  
Just give it one more try  
With a lullaby  
And turn this up on the radio  
If you can hear me now  
I'm reachin' out to let you know  
That you're not alone  
  
And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell  
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone  
So just close your eyes  
Well honey here comes a lullaby  
Your very own lullaby  
Well honey here comes a lullaby

Before I walk away,

And wash it all away  
If you could say the words  
That make me want to stay  
Just tell me there's a chance  
To Hell with all the blame.  
If you could take my hand,  
If you could lead the way,  
I want you to make me,  
Make me,  
Make me

She must have done something wrong tonight  
The living room becomes a boxing ring  
It's time to run when you see him clenching his hands  
She's just a woman, never again  
  
I hear her scream from down the hall  
Amazing she can even talk at all  
She cries to me ""go back to bed""  
I'm terrified that she'll wind up dead in his hands  
She's just a woman, never again  
  
Been there before but not like this  
Seen it before but not like this  
Never before have I ever seen it this bad  
She's just a woman, never again  
  
Just tell the nurse you slipped an fell  
It starts to sting as it starts to swell  
She looks at you, she wants the truth  
It's right out there in the waiting room with those hands  
Lookin' just as sweet as he can, never again  
  
Seen it before but not like this  
Been there before but not like this  
Never before have I ever seen it this bad  
She's just a woman, never again  
  
Father's a name you haven't earned yet  
You're just a child with a temper  
Haven't you heard ""don't hit a lady""  
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure  
  
He's drunk again, it's time to fight  
Same old shit, just on a different night  
She grabs the gun, she's had enough  
Tonight she'll find out how fuckin' tough is this man  
Pulls the trigger fast as she can, never again  
  
Seen it before but not like this  
Been there before but not like this  
Never before have I ever seen it this bad

42,"Two men  
They started walking  
Started talking 'bout better days  
One says to the other  
We do it all again  
Seems I knew I would  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
Now I feel it  
Feel like I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Somebody help me breathe  
  
Here we are again  
Just face to facing  
Each other another day  
Who wins  
Well who cares  
It always ends up the same  
Seems I knew I would  
  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
And now I feel it  
Feel that I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Would somebody help me stand  
And now I've told them  
Already warned them  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me breathe  
  
If I was them  
Then I want to be  
What I see  
If I could drag my life in a moment  
Want to know do you want me to go  
Gonna keep it all from ending  
Never stop myself from pretending  
That you always knew that I never could  
  
All I ever really wanted was to be the same  
Equal treatment never ever comes  
And there they go again  
All I ever really wanted was to be like you  
So perfect  
So worthless  
If I could take it all back think again  
I would  
  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
Now I feel it  
Feel that I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Somebody help me stand

I didn't want this  
I didn't need this

Would somebody help me breathe  
Would somebody help me?

43,"Have I gone all too far?  
Have I been here before?  
If I have let me know  
How it goes  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
Watch her die...  
To run through fields  
To find, and I will  
Hold, then lead, then lie  
And I will...no I won't  
  
Is it now really time?  
Can I just give mine, if  
I can simply trade  
Deal made  
  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
  
Watch her die...

To find, and I will  
Hold, then lead, then lie

Run, hide away from me  
Desouled, to seek, decide  
And I will, no I won't  
  
Run through fields to find  
Hold then lead, then lie  
And I will  
Run, desouled, and  
Hold, to heal, to find  
And I can't

44,"Bribing me, We come, We watched how  
We're last to throw our pennies  
A passive tramps lifts her skirt  
And asks us then we throw them down to her  
  
And I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
  
We don't want to live in the sun  
Just to keep them happy for awhile  
Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and  
Fairly tied up too  
  
But I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If you're my brother, then I will follow you  
  
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends  
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies  
Who's stronger, who's lived longer?  
World quarrels and grandkids on your knee  
  
Cause I know I will always follow  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If you're my brother, then I will follow you

I will follow you and I will

And your word, much better than my word

46,"I asked you to stay  
But you said there's no way

I'll still follow you home  
I'll still follow you home  
  
You can make a couple calls  
And tell your brothers I'm in town  
Put a bounty on my head  
And tell my parents that I'm dead  
And hope to hell I'm never found  
You can steal me the keys  
To your daddy's Cadillac  
You can tamper with the brakes  
Call it a mistake

49,"Lost it on the chesterfield  
Or maybe on  
A gamblin' wheel  
Lost it in a diamond mine  
It's dark as hell  
And hard to find  
You can climb to the  
Top of the highest tree  
You can look around  
But you still won't see  
What I'm lookin' for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
Well I still don't know  
  
Out in the back  
In the old corn field  
Underneath the tractor wheel  
Thought I'd dig  
Till I'd found it first  
Broke my back  
And died of thirst  
You can bribe the devil  
You can pray to God  
You can sell off  
Everything you got  
And you still won't know  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
And you still don't know  
  
Saw it on the silver screen  
Preacher says  
""Don't know what it means""  
Last page ad  
In a comic book  
Bought me a map  
Showed me where to look  
It ain't carved of stone  
Or made of wood  
And if you paid for it  
Then it's still no good  
And you still won't know  
What I'm looking for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?

50,"This time I wonder what it feels like  
To find the one in this life  
The one we all dream of  
But dreams just aren't enough  
So I'll be waiting for the real thing  
I'll know it by the feeling  
The moment when we're meeting  
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen  
So I'll be holdin' my breath  
Right up to the end  
Until that moment when  
I find the one that I'll spend forever with  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there.  
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Someone to love with my life in their hands.  
There's gotta be somebody for me like that.  
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.  
  
Tonight, out on the street out in the moonlight  
And damn it this feels too right  
It's just like deja vu  
Me standin' here with you  
So I'll be holdin' my breath  
Could this be the end?  
Is it that moment when  
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't give up  
When you're lookin' for a diamond in the rough  
Because you never know when it shows up  
Make sure you're holdin' on  
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on  
  
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there.  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Someone to love with my life in their hands.  
There's gotta be somebody for me.  
  
Oh, nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.  
  
Nobody wants to be the last one there  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.

51,"My hopes just fell, and I can't see  
The reason why, why there is blood on my sleeve  
And all this time, I thought it mine  
But it's not, it's yours and  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow  
  
And I don't see too well, don't sing too well  
And I settle to scream  
Just grab your shit, and leave with it  
They won't make no statues of you  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow  
This label ""thief"", find a better title suited for you  
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you  
  
This time I've forgotten  
I swear this shit was rotten  
This time, I believe it  
'Cause I've seen the shit you're needin'  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow

I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,

Give my life for you

My mind was closing, now I'm believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,  
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will  
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,  
I'd search forever just to bring you home,  
Here and now, this I vow

One day, up to a cliff  
That overlooked the water  
I jumped in to save a girl  
It was somebody's daughter  
And now the ring is on my hand  
It was given to me by her  
To this day we all sit around  
And dream of ways to get higher  
To get much higher

57,"Hey there little darling, where'd the old man go?  
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long?  
We can lie out in the field til the morning light  
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight  
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch  
And then the old man come a-runnin' with a hickory switch.  
  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, have gotta learn the hard way.  
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go.  
I'll race you for your pink slip right before this show.  
Throw your girlfriend in the bet to make things good.  
Cause she's been staring at me like no girlfriend should.  
  
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line  
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, have gotta learn the hard way.

58,"I saw the river, just pulled him down  
I knew the man who hunted him down  
We watched the river, take him away  
Before he died, I could have sworn he said  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
  
Tired and afraid lies a saddened man  
Knelt beside him with head in hand  
And escaped life here with a lonely breath  
But before he died I could have sworn he said  
  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
Who ever gave a damn about you  
I am sorry  
I am sorry  
I was wrong  
I was wrong  
I've been wrong for way too long  
I am sorry that you're gone

Buried underneath the water  
Now they consult a psychic  
Find how much I like it  
And now I've found a little friend  
It's too fast  
This won't last  
And to touch  
Hurts too much  
And now I've found a little friend  
  
And now it's just you and me  
Borrow one and we will make three  
I say we steal one more  
Just like we did once before  
  
And now I thought I told her  
That she won't get much older  
And now I've found a little friend  
  
And now it makes no difference  
'Cause I am not quite in yet  
And now its on the table  
'Cause she's perfectly able  
And now I've found a little friend

Well my favorite little waitress has  
Ahold of my eyes  
But here's a shotgun  
Loaded hidden under the bar  
Her finger's on the trigger  
If anybody gets out of line  
  
There's other places that are better to go  
But I'm addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded

And she talks like a trucker  
Doesn't want a lollipop  
But she sure loves a sucker

I'm cutting to the front of the line  
Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila  
And a lime for her lips  
Laid her body on the bar  
And put the salt on her hips  
Was lying when I told her  
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight

I just woke up from a dream today  
Time gone by but you still look the same  
Felt so real to have you back with me  
It's just too bad it's just another dream  
Give me just one wish...  
  
If I could give it all away  
I'd do it just for one more day  
I thought I had the time to wait

That I  
  
I miss you

I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I miss you so much  
I miss you so much  
  
After dark, laughin' in the rain  
Silver heart locket on a chain  
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey  
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away  
Give me just one wish...  
  
If I could give it all away  
I'd do it just for one more day  
Trade it in for one more moment  
Tell you what I never told ya  
All the things I left unsaid  
I meant to say before you left  
I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you  
  
I miss you  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do

I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I miss you so much  
I miss you so much  
  
If there was some way, you know I would  
I'd do it today, I wish I could  
I call out your name, it does no good  
I wish I knew what would  
  
I... I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I wish my wish was enough  
Give me just one wish...

Favorite trick she does, one in ten that she's got  
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try  
All the looks, by the book, best that money can buy  
  
Look what your money bought  
It's all that she's got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy  
  
Last chance to dance, out in back of the bar  
Shakin' hands, nice to meet you, I don't know who you are  
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man  
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can

63,"Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you.  
Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,  
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you.  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
You're never gonna be alone!  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone.  
  
And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,  
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
We're gonna take the world on  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh,  
You've gotta live every single day,  
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Don't let it slip away,  
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun  
Every single day,  
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you.

I won't be missing one more day,  
I'm gonna be there always,  
I won't be missing one more day.

64,"I judge by what she's wearing  
Just how many heads I'm tearing  
Off of assholes keep coming on to her  
Each night seems like it's getting worse  
And I wish she'd take the night off  
So I don't have to fight off  
Every asshole coming on to her  
It happens every night she works  
They'll go and ask the DJ  
Find out just what would she say  
If they all tried coming on to her  
Don't they know it's never going to work?  
They think they'll get it inside her  
With every drink they buy her  
As they all try coming on to her  
This time somebody's getting hurt

Here comes the next contestant  
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?  
Is that your hand?  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
There goes the next contestant  
  
I even fear the ladies  
They're cool but twice as crazy  
Just as bad for coming on to her  
Don't they know it's never gonna work?

Somebody's grabbing her ass  
Everyone is coming on to her  
This time somebody's getting hurt

Everybody here keeps staring

Is that your hand?

65,"I wanna do it 'till the sun comes up  
Until we're both so good and sweaty  
That we can't stand up  
I wanna do it 'till we're both about to drop  
As long as we're tied up together  
Then we're never gonna stop  
  
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain  
Because they heard somebody screamin'  
And they think we're both in pain  
I wanna go so long your parents think you've died  
There gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI

Yeah,  
We're gonna love it when the lights go down  
Hold on here we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna go until our legs give out  
Round and round we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna do it hanging upside down  
Up and down we go  
Yeah,  
We're getting ready for the next go round  
Round and round we go  
  
So shut the windows, lock the doors, unplug the phone  
For all intents and purposes there ain't nobody home  
Then we can do it 'till the batteries are done  
And borrow two from the TV remote  
To turn this thing back on  
  
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub  
We can roll around for hours without ever comin' up  
I want you naked with your favorite heels on  
Slap John Deere across my ass  
And ride me up and down the lawn

Holes in hand where a cross used to fit just right  
The meeting called, the topic: a ladies fate  
You don't have to remind me  
I won't be late  
  
Please excuse me, I'm sorry I just can't wait  
And don't use grandfather as the bait  
  
Down the hall the baby boy just born  
Rosary around a crown of thorns  
  
Please excuse me, I'm sorry I just can't wait  
And don't use grandfather as the bait  
  
Can't you see the lady's not ready  
Hands and fee are bound and unsteady  
In the hall the family's grieving  
I'm the one who stays  
I'm not leavin' yet

67,"She's old enough  
She knows enough  
She's thrown up  
So throw her  
Out to me

You got your way and I'll get mine  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in this discussion  
  
Should have known enough  
Never grown enough  
Alone enough  
To know my  
  
Where would be  
The path I wanted to try  
If it fairs to be  
Good for me than I'd rather die  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in this discussion  
  
Black words always lead to something  
Bury her cause her time was cut thin  
All the while you just stood and stared  
Never cared to help we just got carried away  
  
Lately it seems like my dreams have started to die  
It occurred to me on the inside I guess so have I  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in the last ones coming  
  
Standing here with my two feet  
Enjoy it now cause it won't be  
Some way  
Some how  
The things that keep me alive  
Aren't livin' here anymore

68,"Look at this photograph  
Every time I do it makes me laugh  
How did our eyes get so red?  
And what the hell is on Joey's head?  
  
This is where I grew up  
I think the present owner fixed it up  
I never knew we ever went without  
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out  
  
And this is where I went to school  
Most of the time I had better things to do  
Criminal record says I broke in twice  
I must of done it half a dozen times  
  
I wonder if it's too late  
Should I go back and try to graduate?  
Lot's better now than it was back then  
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I  
  
[Chorus]  
Every memory of lookin' out the back door  
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor  
It's hard to say it  
Time to say it  
Good bye, good bye  
Every memory of walkin' out the front door  
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for  
It's hard to say it  
Time to say it  
Good bye, good bye, good bye  
  
Remember the old arcade?  
Blew every dollar that we ever made  
The cops hated us hangin' out  
They said somebody went and burnt it down  
  
We use to listen to the radio  
And sing along with every song we know  
We said someday we'd find out how it feels  
To sing to more than just a steering wheel  
  
Kim's the first girl I kissed  
I was so nervous that I nearly missed  
She's had a couple of kids since then  
I haven't seen her since God knows when  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I miss that town  
I miss their faces  
You can't erase  
You can't replace it  
I miss it now  
I can't believe it  
So hard to stay  
Too hard to leave it  
  
If I could relive those days  
I know the one thing that would never change

Look at this photograph  
Every time I do it makes me laugh  
Every time I do it makes me

I need  
I don't ask much anymore  
I found something  
  
Throw a stone into the water  
The ripple is broke  
Burn them, baby  
Just for holding the cradle too close  
Take it all back  
Search for justice, don't live there anymore  
And he said  
  
I need  
I don't ask much anymore  
I found something  
Yeah  
  
And why do you see me in this way?  
The way that I did  
I gave him the means to the end  
Yes I did  
I bothered not to believe in this way  
The way that I did  
I made him just to see in this way  
The way that I did

We'll go out onto the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
  
After hours and alcohol  
Every club, we've seen 'em all  
As long as we don't need to stand in line  
Party scenes and billboard dreams  
The ladies love those limousines  
You know were gonna show up every time  
  
Well see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while your wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out on the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
(burn it down)  
  
Crowds that scream at superstars  
Where bouncers show their battle scars  
I've been the first to sign on every wall  
Down the road and round the bend  
We pray to god it never ends  
I've been, I've seen, we've screamed to everyone  
  
We'll see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while you're wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out onto the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
(burn it down)  
Light it up 'til we burn it down  
(you know were gonna)  
Light it up till we burn it down

75,"(Hey, hey) She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door  
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor  
It's the only way to LA that she knows  
The Hollywood pose, teeth, tits, and toes  
Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard  
So many five star friends with black credit cards  
She'd try anything once, 'cause anything goes  
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap  
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week  
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
  
(Hey, hey) I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book  
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look  
Every A list player is a favorite friend  
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz  
Her congressman will call her every once in a while  
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile  
She's done everyone once, and everyone knows  
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press  
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best  
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest  
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands.

76,"She's got me nervous  
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour  
She's more than worth it  
I swear she smells just like a flower  
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her  
I love when she says ""what's wrong with right here on the counter?""  
  
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster  
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister  
Coca-Cola rollercoaster  
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.

Sometimes I feel like I can taste it  
This evil romance  
So good I never wanna waste it  
I can't trust my friends  
'Cause she's what everybody chases  
I know where she's been  
'Cause it's on everybody's faces  
  
I never wanna have to slow down  
Got to be a better way to come down  
I've gotta stay awake some how

Don't remember them being here before  
Smell of perfume is in here, why's lipstick on the mirror  
And still I don't understand  
  
No pictures left in the hall  
There's three new holes in my wall  
Where the hell's my credit cards, why's my wallet in the yard  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why's love gotta be so tough  
  
Should see the look on my face  
My shit's all over the place  
Why's this happening to me, why'd you take both sets of keys  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other

78,"[Verse 1:]  
Yeah the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along  
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we both just better off  
Well the preacher believes that I'll meet all of these demons hanging on  
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along

Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)

I think one wheel's coming off  
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?  
So kind of you to help me out

79,"I reside in 209, you're in 208  
You moved in last Friday night  
And I just couldn't wait  
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday  
But a lineup formed outside your door  
And I was way too late  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God, I want to be that someone that you're with  
  
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday  
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake  
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at four AM  
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place

80,"Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body  
They say it's over budget but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on  
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene  
If Hollywood had called her she'd be gone before your holler, come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
(Your such a mover)  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
Your so much cooler when you never pull it out  
Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth  
  
Crafty little lip tricks  
Tattoos on her left hip  
She bending as your spending  
There's no ending it so baby come on  
Dressed up like a princess  
Bettin' that her skin smells better  
Than the scent of every flower in the desert come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along

She loves the night scene bar queen  
Was living for the fun taking over every dance floor like shes the only one  
In the spotlight all night dissin' everyone  
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb  
  
Your so much cooler  
When you never pull it out  
So much cuter  
With something in your mouth

Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
I love the way you dance with anybody

81,"Lookin' like another Bob Marley day  
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train  
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon  
  
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall  
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked 'em all  
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon  
  
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor  
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more  
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just sitting around, hangin' out this afternoon  
  
Landlord says I should buy a tent  
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent  
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon  
  
Down on the corner in a seedy bar  
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR  
Had a few, to Suzy Q this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
  
Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock  
To see what time it is  
From the moment I wake up  
I just love being with my friends  
We barely get by but have the best times  
And hope it never ends  
We drink all day until we fall down  
So we can do it all again  
  
It's not the human walk  
It's the human race  
If you ain't livin' on edge  
You're takin' too much space  
So I doubt I'll figure out  
Just what to do  
'Bout to kick it around  
Hanging out this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out

We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Just sitting around  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

82,"To line up to the ring  
For a battle that you can't win  
Swing as hard as you can swing  
It will still mean nothing  
Should've seen it coming  
It had to happen sometime  
But you went and brought a knife  
To an all out gunfight  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
You've gone too far, who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for, well this means war  
  
Say anything you want  
But talk will get you nowhere  
The only thing you brought is psychological warfare  
Well there's no getting off  
And now you got to wonder  
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
You've gone too far, who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for, well this means war  
  
And the only thing to save

[Chorus]  
But if there's a pill to help me forget,  
God knows I haven't found it yet  
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to  
  
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far  
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart  
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more  
  
And this kind of pain, only time takes away  
That's why it's harder to let you go  
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you  
That's why it's harder to let you go  
But if there's a pill to help me forget,  
God knows I haven't found it yet  
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to  
  
It's trying not to love you, only goes so far  
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart  
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
  
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself  
Was it something that I did?  
Was there somebody else?  
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears  
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear  
Tonight I'm dying to tell you  
  
That trying not to love you, only went so far  
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart  
Now I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for  
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more

When we could feed a starving world  
With what we throw away

A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent  
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this  
  
Well I'm hating, all of this  
I'm hating, all of this  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change  
If you don't like, there's the door, nobody made you stay  
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it  
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this  
  
Well I'm hating, all of this  
I'm hating, all of this  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

Let's rip out yours instead of mine.  
And all you need  
Are several ways to watch me bleed.  
  
Well, thanks for stopping this beating in my chest.  
It's easier now, and I'm happy like this.
