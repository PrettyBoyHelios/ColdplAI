0,Bon Jovi,Ain't No Cure For Love (Crush Demo),"Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure  
Cupid was a blind man  
He must have missed his mark  
Shot an arrow in the air and hit me in the heart  
I went to see Saint Valentine  
Said Whats come over me?  
Daddy must have missed the chapter about the birds and bees  
You can be the King of diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You could hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
Now someone call my lawyer  
I'm going to see my shrink  
I found myself in the jewelry store buying a diamond ring  
I went to see my doctor  
Said Wont you help me please?  
He said Son I'm sorry, its a terminal disease  
Can't get no love insurance  
Cupid draws his bow  
I aint waving boys, I'm drowning  
Its a damn good way to go  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
You can be the King of Diamonds  
You can cash in all your gold  
You can hire Johnnie Cochran  
Its too late to save your soul  
Don't need no shot, no ambulance  
Don't need prescription drugs  
There aint no cure for love  
They can find the cure for the common cold  
When the pushing comes to shove  
There aint no cure for love  
No aspirin  
No ambulance  
Or Voodoo you can think up  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
Aint no cure for love  
There aint no cure for love

1,Bon Jovi,Alive,"Feel me like I feel you  
Won't you let me come inside  
Heal me like I heal you  
Let your mind, body, soul, come alive  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey Hey I'm Alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Hey hey I survived  
It's a brand new day  
And I feel fine  
  
Here to say I'm alive  
Want me like I want you  
That's my heart you hold in your hands  
Touch me like I touch you  
Make me feel like superman  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive

And I feel fine  
  
Here to stay I'm alive  
Like the wind run with me  
Take my hand come with me  
Those bastards ain't bringing us down  
For all the dreams that died  
And all of the tears they cried  
If there's one thing I've learned  
Life is now  
On my knees (but I'm Rising)  
On My Feet (Getting Higher)  
I will fly  
  
Hey hey I'm alive  
Didn't think I'd make it to the other side  
Her to stay I'm alive (Didn't think I'd make it)

And I feel Fine

2,Bon Jovi,All About Loving You,"Looking at the pages of my life  
Faded memories of me and you  
Mistakes you know I've made a few  
I took some shots and fell from time to time  
Baby, you were there to pull me through  
We've been around the block a time or two  
I'm gonna lay it on the line  
Ask me how we've come this far  
The answer's written in my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time  
When I look at what my life's been comin' to  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
I've lived, I've loved, I've lost, I've paid some dues, baby  
We've been to hell and back again  
Through it all you're always my best friend  
For all the words I didn't say and all the things I didn't do  
Tonight I'm gonna find a way  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more  
I don't wanna sleep tonight, dreamin's just a waste of time  
When I look at what my life's been comin' to  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
You can take this world away  
You're everything I am  
Just read the lines upon my face  
I'm all about lovin' you  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every time I look at you, baby, I see something new  
That takes me higher than before and makes me want you more

3,Bon Jovi,All I Wanna Do Is You,"Working hard eight days a week  
Most days we've got no time to speak  
Feels like I'm chasing after my own life  
Girl can't you see you're my only vice  
  
Take the phone off the hook  
Turn the lights down low  
We'll play some old Sam Cooke  
Baby, let yourself go  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't care what kinda clothes you wear  
It doesn't matter how you do your hair  
I don't need no champagne on ice  
Girl, can't you see that you're my only vice  
  
Turn the whole world off  
Keep your high heels on  
Take it nice and slow  
And make it last 'til dawn  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
I don't wanna eat, I don't wanna sleep  
Don't wanna sit around and watch TV  
When you're next to me it's where I wanna be  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I, I wanna do  
  
All I wanna do is you  
All I wanna do is you  
I'll do anything you want me to, but  
All I wanna do is you  
  
All I wanna, all I wanna, all I wanna do  
All I wanna do now, all I wanna do is you  
Baby is you

4,Bon Jovi,All I Want Is Everything,"Some fifteen year old kid sits on his porch  
Just half-past noon, trying to figure out just what he's doing  
Why he had to grow up so soon  
With all the gangs, all the guns, watcha gonna learn in school?  
There's got to be some way out of here  
He says, ""Man, this life is cruel""  
I knew this Puerto Rican girl who lied to change her life  
She changed her name, her face  
Because the grass looked greener on the other side  
She turned her back, she ran away straight into the night  
Her friends, her family feel the pain but she's the one who cries  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr., I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything  
My next door neighbor Donnie  
Died in his room just the other day  
His brother come home  
Found him dead on the floor with a needle in his vein  
Cops come down with a body bag  
They said Donnie was a casualty  
I said, all it's about is the boy checked out  
He couldn't handle reality  
Tell me what you want  
Tell me what you need  
I want everything  
I've had enough of having nothing, I won't take just anything  
I got my mind set on something, all I want is everything  
It's my life Mr. I ain't running, I'm no puppet on a string  
I want more than I see coming  
All I want is everything, all I want is everything

5,Bon Jovi,"All Talk, No Action","First time I saw you girl,  
I knew that it wouldn't be long  
I tried holding back my feelings  
But you came on so strong  
No one told me about her  
But I know they all knew  
That I know all about the girls  
That do the things you do  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
  
You're playing those games with me baby,  
But one of us has got to win  
Someday all the boys are gonna find out  
That you won't even play it with them  
You're running out of numbers baby  
You won't say no, you just say maybe  
One of these days you're gonna get  
What's coming to you  
  
Cause you're all talk, no action  
All talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
You better stop this fooling around  
You're all talk no action  
You turn it up to cool me down, cool me down, cool me down  
  
Sticks and stones will break my bones  
But their names could never hurt me  
Cause I ain't afraid of you running away  
If you love me tonight then desert me  
  
Cause you're all talk, and no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk, but no action  
You're all talk  
You're all talk, no action  
You're all talk, no action  
All talk, no action  
All talk, no action

6,Bon Jovi,Always,"This Romeo is bleeding, but you can't see his blood  
It's nothing but some feelings  
That this old dog kicked up  
It's been raining since you left me  
Now I'm drowning in the flood  
You see I've always been a fighter  
But without you I give up  
  
Now I can't sing a love song  
Like the way it's meant to be  
Well,I guess I'm not that good anymore  
But baby, that's just me  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
  
Now we're picture's that you left behind  
Are just memories of a different life  
Some that made us laugh  
Some that made us cry  
One that made you have to say goodbye  
  
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair  
Touch your lips, to hold you near,  
When you say your prayers, try to understand  
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man  
  
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near  
When he says the words  
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him  
'Cause these words are mine, to say to you  
'Til the end of time  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
If you told me to cry for you, I could  
If you told me to die for you, I would  
Take a look at my face  
There's no price I won't pay  
To say these words to you  
  
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice  
But baby, if you give me just one more try  
We can pack up our old dreams, and our old lives,  
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines  
  
Yeah I, will love you, baby  
Always and I'll be there  
Forever and a day, always  
  
I'll be there, till the stars don't shine  
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme  
I know when I die you'll be on my mind  
And I'll love you, always  
Always

7,Bon Jovi,Always Run To You,"The clock strikes ten  
Out on the streets again  
I been looking for something to please me since I don't know when  
Out on the dark side of town  
Another rumbles gone down  
And life on the high side isn't what this boys about  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me  
I stand accused  
That I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
To a heart of chrome  
And a soul of steel  
We've done more white lines than you'll know any one we could steal  
And when I give her the gun  
You know she feels so right  
And we don't let go when we're alone when I'm holding her so tight.  
  
She's got something I want man, it's something I need  
It takes more than the night to satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run  
  
And when the morning comes and I go to sleep  
When I close my eyes she's waiting for me  
I know that tonight she'll satisfy me.  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
Any road that you choose  
I can always run to you  
I stand accused  
I can always run to you  
I run to you  
Baby, I can always run

Oh, beautiful for spacious skies  
For amber waves of grain  
For purple mountain's majesties  
Above the fruited plain  
  
America, America  
God shed his grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
  
Oh, beautiful for patriot dream  
That sees beyond the years  
Thine alabaster cities gleam  
Undimmed by human tears

And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea

9,Bon Jovi,American Dreams,"I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me.  
I used to see you on every tv  
Your smiling face looked back at me.  
  
Then they caught you with the girl next door,  
People's money piled on the floor,  
Accusations that you try to deny,  
Revelations and rumours begin to fly.  
  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above.  
Now you think about reaching out  
Try to get some help from above.  
  
Reporters crowd around your house.  
Going through your garbage like a pack of hounds,  
Speculating what they may find out,  
It don't matter now, you're all washed up.  
  
You wake up in the middle of the night.  
Your sheets are wet and your face is white,  
You tried to make a good thing last,  
How could something so good, go bad, so fast?  
  
American dream, American dream,  
American dream, American dream.  
  
Don't know when things went wrong,  
Might have been when you were young and strong. (X 2)

10,Bon Jovi,Another Reason To Believe,"Love lives in New York City  
He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey, hallelujah, baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mother's eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn baby's cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning 'round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you, baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere you'll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
It's different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fire's falling from the sky  
Innocence just said goodbye  
It may never be the same  
Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly

13,Bon Jovi,Ballad Of Youth,"(sambora, morolda)  
  
Growing up today  
Theres many mountains you must climb  
Youre not the only one  
Cause everybodys on that line  
Hey mister know it all  
What do you recommend  
You think you know the answers  
But the questions never end  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Born outta passion  
To a world gone cold  
Ya wear it on your shoulders  
Its a heavy, heavy load I know  
Love and its emotions  
Come knocking at your door  
Young hearts will be broken  
And times the only cure  
  
Young hearts better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
So look in your mirror  
You got nothing to lose  
Don't waste your time away  
Thinkin bout yesterdays blues  
  
Temptation makes us fall from grace  
But the angels were sinners  
And the sinners saints  
Forgive yourself cause were all the same  
Everybody rides on the karma train  
  
Young hearts  
Better hold on  
Beyond the innocence  
Your youth is gone  
Look in your mirror  
Itll tell you the truth  
Don't waste your time away  
Don't waste your life away, no, no  
Live today  
Theres no time to lose  
Cause when tomorrow comes  
Its all just yesterdays news  
  
All just yesterday news

14,Bon Jovi,Bang A Drum,"I went to see the preacher  
To teach me how to pray  
He looked at me and smiled  
Then the preacher turned away  
He said if you want to tell him something  
You ain't gotta fold your hands  
Say it with your heart  
Your soul and believe it  
And I'd say amen  
  
Bang a drum for the sinners  
Bang a drum for the sins  
Bang a drum for the losers  
And those who win  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for yourself son  
And a drum for me  
  
I called upon my brother just the  
Other day, he said: John I'm gonna  
Die if I don't start to live again  
I work each day and night like clockwork  
Just trying to make ends meet  
I could kick this bad world's ass  
If I could just get on my feet  
  
I'd bang a drum for the dying  
Bang a drum for the truth  
Bang a drum for the innocence  
Lost in our youth  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
Bang a drum for you brother  
And a drum for me  
  
I don't know where all the rivers run  
I don't know how far, I don't know how come  
But I'm gonna die believin'  
Each step that I take  
Ain't worth the ground that  
I walk on  
If we don't walk it our  
Own way  
  
No I don't claim to be a wise man  
A poet or a saint  
I'm just another man who's searching  
For a better way  
But my heart beats loud as thunder  
For the things that I believe  
Sometimes I wanna run for cover  
Sometimes I want to scream  
  
Bang a drum for tomorrow  
Bang a drum for the past  
Bang a drum for the heroes  
That won't come back  
Bang a drum for the promise  
Bang a drum for the lies  
Bang a drum for the lovers  
And the tears they've cried  
Bang a drum bang it loudly  
Or as soft as you need  
But as long as my heart keeps on bangin'  
I got a reason to believe

15,Bon Jovi,Bed Of Roses,"Sitting here wasted and wounded  
At this old piano  
Trying hard to capture  
The moment this morning I don't know  
'Cause a bottle of vodka  
Is still lodged in my head  
And some blond gave me nightmares  
I think she is still in my bed  
As I dream about movies  
They won't make of me when I'm dead  
  
With an ironclad fist I wake up and  
French kiss the morning  
While some marching band keeps  
Its own beat in my head  
While we're talking  
About all of the things that I long to believe  
About love and the truth and  
What you mean to me  
And the truth is baby you're all that I need  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
Well I'm so far away  
That each step that I take is on my way home  
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night  
Just to see through this payphone  
Still I run out of time  
Or it's hard to get through  
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you  
I'll just close my eyes and whisper,  
Baby blind love is true  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses  
  
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry  
The barkeeper's wig's crooked  
And she's giving me the eye  
I might have said yeah  
But I laughed so hard I think I died  
  
When you close your eyes  
Know I'll be thinking about you  
While my mistress she calls me  
To stand in her spotlight again  
Tonight I won't be alone  
But you know that don't  
Mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove  
For it's you that I'd die to defend  
  
I want to lay you down on a bed of roses  
For tonight I sleep on a bed on nails  
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is  
And lay you down on bed of roses

"
16,Bon Jovi,Better Think Twice,"I just want all those modern romances  
Always being in love  
When any girl smiled at me I went wild at the touch of her clothes  
Then bang it's off before I know it  
Poor broken hearted me  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
Jackie's all alone in her room with the TV on  
And she's crying, crying  
Wondering about how her and Joey been getting along  
All this lying, lying  
Tell her this, tell her that  
Where's these lies gonna end  
Things would be much better if her and Joey just stayed friends  
  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
  
What's in it for you?  
He's trying to shoot you down  
Long hot summer nights  
Go out now and find that girl and hold her tight  
Like she's the only girl in the world  
  
You better think twice  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love  
Better think twice before falling in love again  
Better think twice before falling in love

17,Bon Jovi,Billy,"Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Since you've been gone now, honey  
Life ain't nothing but sad luck days  
I begged on my knees now, sugar  
You acted like you never knew my name  
  
My friends saw you at the station  
I guess you must have missed your train  
  
Tell me is it 'cause you love me, Billy  
Or is it just because you love the pain?  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
How come you're sad when I get happy?  
Why do you laugh when I want to cry?  
Tell me why when I say I need you  
You turn around and you say goodbye?  
  
Why do you think that a heart's so fragile?  
Can you tell me why love's so blind?  
Just like a magnet you pull me under  
I can't resist you, we're two of a kind  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
Billy, Billy  
Can we be lovers and friends?  
Life is like a movie but this ain't pretend  
There really have to be a happy end  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman  
But I love you just the same  
  
I never said you had to walk on water  
Or that I could ever stop the rain  
Sometimes we break up just to make up, baby  
And we don't care who's to blame  
  
Billy, Billy  
Ain't love hard to explain?  
For a debutante you're a real hard woman

18,Bon Jovi,Bitter Wine,"We met some time ago when we were almost young  
It never crossed my mind to ask where did you come from  
I didn't have much money so I stole you a rose  
You were dressed like an orphan in salvation army clothes  
  
I never thought I'd lose you,nor I'd rather go blind  
I thought I saw a future but the fortune teller lied  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
I know I wasn't funny but you laughed at all my jokes  
When I was choking on the words to say you your fingers down my throat  
The first night I said I love you you told me to go to hell  
You were giving me head on that creaky bed at the old duval motel  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
Ain't no sympathy when it says goodbye  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Just like everything good love has to die  
No one even cried we were one of a kind  
  
Love left me stranded at the station and the last train's gone by  
What was once holy water tastes like bitter wine  
  
Your love was my salvation it could always get me high  
You take back the holy water now all that's left is bitter wine

"
19,Bon Jovi,Blood Money,"Hey Patty Garrett that's what I used to call you  
They tell me you want me but I hear they've got you  
They made you a lawman with a badge made of silver  
They paid you some money to sell them my blood  
  
But you say this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
I wonder what would have happened  
If you were the killer  
And I was the hero  
Would things be the same  
Or would I have traded  
Your life for my own life  
Would I have paid  
Your debts in your place  
  
But this ain't about me, this ain't about you  
Or the good and the bad times we've both been through  
When the lines between brothers and justice have changed  
You do what you've got to cause you can't walk away  
  
Blood money  
That's what I call it  
'Cause money for blood ain't no fair exchange  
Blood money  
Bought and then sold you  
But your conscience is all you can take to your grave

20,Bon Jovi,Bobby's Girl,"I'd give you my ring, I'd fill you with promises  
I'd give you anything you want

Run with me baby, on a magic carpet ride  
Well live for tomorrow, everything I'll be alright  
Cause it don't matter what they say  
  
She's Bobby's girl, Johnny, you're playing with dynamite.  
She's Bobby's girl, close the door baby, it'll be alright

21,Bon Jovi,Born To Be My Baby,"Rainy night and we worked all day  
We both got jobs 'cause there's bills to pay  
We got something they can't take away  
Our love, our lives  
  
Close the door, leave the cold outside  
I don't need nothing when I'm by your side  
We got something that'll never die  
Our dreams, our pride  
  
My heart beats like a drum (all night)  
Flesh to flesh, one to one (and it's alright)  
And I'll never let go cause  
There's something I know deep inside  
  
You were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we don't know where we stand  
Only God would know the reasons  
But I bet he must have had a plan  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
Light a candle, blow the world away  
Table for two on a TV tray  
It ain't fancy, baby that's OK  
Our time, our way  
  
So hold me close better hang on tight  
Buckle up, baby, it's a bumpy ride  
We're two kids hitching down the road of life  
Our world, our fight  
  
If we stand side by side (all night)  
There's a chance we'll get by (and it's alright)  
And I'll know that you'll be live  
In my heart till the day that I die  
  
Cause you were born to be my baby  
And baby, I was made to be your man  
  
We got something to believe in  
Even if we don't know where we stand

22,Bon Jovi,Breakout,"This time girl i've had enough  
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves  
It's too late i hear a knock on the door  
The game's over baby i can't take it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
Breakout, breakout  
Take these chains from me  
You held my heart for ransom  
Baby, set it free  
Breakout, breakout  
Your lies can't hide what i see  
I'm better off on my own  
  
Promises made me in the heat of the night (whoa-oh-oh)  
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (whoa-oh)  
Your lips they burn your body calls my name (whoa-oh)  
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (whoa-oh)

You're gonna make me feel oh so right  
I'm saying oh no not tonight  
You gotta let me go

23,Bon Jovi,Captain Crash And The Beauty Queen From Mars,"Dressed up for a big date  
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now  
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face  
She was one of a kind  
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella  
And roller skates in bed  
  
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown  
When he comes around 'cause they don't let him drive now  
Mixed up as a milkshake  
But make no mistake  
They're shooting for the stars  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
Share a toothpick, trading lipstick  
Watching traffic for days at the diner  
Holding hands, making big plans  
Playing Superman, he was wearing eyeliner  
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldn't play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
They're drunk on love as you can get  
Getting high on lust and cigarettes  
Living life with no regrets  
At least they're gonna try to fly  
  
[Chorus:]  
You and me  
We're invincible together  
We can be so tragical, whatever  
We're Sid and Nancy  
Fred and Ginger  
Clyde and Bonnie  
Liz and Richard  
Kurt and Courtney  
Bacall and Bogie  
Joltin' Joe and Ms. Monroe

24,Bon Jovi,Church Of Desire,"(sambora)  
  
Woke up in a cold sweat  
In the middle of the night  
Seems like a lifetime  
When youre wondering whos wrong or right  
One confession would resurrect the truth  
Revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo, like a spirit you can't embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror, and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street, lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell, I pray the rain disappears  
I'm headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire

25,Bon Jovi,Come Back,"Now that you're gone, I can see what  
Was going on and how you lied  
When you'd said you'd never love again  
  
Friends telephone and they say  
You weren't out alone last night  
Can't you see that this broken heart  
Is killing me  
  
Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back cause I need your love  
Come back got to have your love  
Come back bring your loving back to me  
Come back cause it's been so long  
Come back, and my love's still strong  
Come back bring your loving back to me  
  
You play with words play with love  
It's just your silly way  
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again  
  
Now it's too late you walk by  
With another man  
And I stand alone  
Cause I know that you're not coming home  
  
Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Another night is falling  
And now my heart is calling you back to me

And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new.  
  
Worry, why do I let myself worry?  
Wonderin', what in the world did I do?  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you.  
  
Crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
I'm crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And I'm crazy for loving you

27,Bon Jovi,Dirty Little Secret,"I light a candle  
In the garden of love  
To blind the angels  
Looking down from above  
I want, I need  
The fruit of your vine  
It tastes so bitter sweet  
'Cause I know it's not mine  
I want to go inside  
Hit the lights and I'll come crawling to your window tonight  
Come on and send the sign  
I'll be your dirty little secret  
And you'll be mine  
You got me knock, knock knocking at your door  
And I'll be coming back for more

Our dirty little secret

When you're holding his hand  
'Cause there's a danger  
That we both understand  
We run like thiefs  
Through the temple of sin  
Till we fall on our knees then you go back to him  
I want to feel alive  
Hit the lights and I'll come crawling to your window tonight  
Come on and send the sign  
I'll be your dirty little secret  
And you'll be mine

28,Bon Jovi,Downside Of Love,"Are. Sambora  
  
Theres a danger of getting so close to you  
There comes a time  
When the walls fade away  
And when love turns to bitter blue  
Sometimes it feels like its so hard to stay  
Last night we went to bed angry  
We didint mean what we said  
Seems we never get past forgiveness  
We try to hide, we never learn  
To swallow our pride.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Baby life has no guarantee  
Never knowing where loves gonna lead  
Even through youre a part of me  
We have to deal with our pain separately  
Sometimes we both feel like victims  
With no easy way out not, no, no  
Somehow we stand by each other  
When were desperate, and drowning in  
The shadows of doubt.  
On the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hate  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
The times we share the tenderness  
Are the times that keep us alive  
You get in my face, you rough me up  
But baby you know  
can't hurt me nough, to give you up  
And make me let go  
Make me let got oh no, no.  
When youre on the down side of love  
Where the love turns to hare  
We just can't relate  
On the down side of love  
When youre misunderstood  
cause when it hurts you  
It hurts you so good.  
Downside of love  
Loves just a long, long road baby  
Yes theres a down side of love  
Stand by my side baby  
When youre on the downside of love  
No, no, no  
Downside of love  
cause its a long, long road baby  
Downside of love.

30,Bon Jovi,Garageland,"I read the paper just the other day  
About a buddy of mine who headed to an early grave  
They say he went in his sleep with a smile on his face  
Bet he was dreaming 'bout better days  
  
When the crash of the drums hit like waves on a beach  
That cheap bass and guitar and our wildest dreams  
We were searching for a savior like anybody else  
Trying to save ourselves from ourselves  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
  
Our parents all held jobs but we had other plans  
We acted like our heroes they just didn't understand  
And we were never afraid to fall  
It was us and those four walls  
  
Just a garage band, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
Just us, those guitars and a Saturday night  
  
'Cause with a strap on your back, you have wings on your feet  
You felt like a king when you walked down the street  
We heard those old records and knew we belonged  
When the drums hit the groove, we'd all sing along  
  
Just a garage band  
Oh, we were livin' in Garageland  
Just a garage band, oh, we weren't alive  
We were livin' in Garageland  
Nothing ever felt so right  
It was us, those guitars and a Saturday night

Who, are you to tell me if it's black or white?  
Mama, can you hear me? Try to understand.  
Is innocence the difference between a boy and a man.  
My daddy lived the lie, it's just the price that he paid.  
Sacrificed his life, just slavin' away.  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.  
Shining like a diamond, rolling with the dice,  
Standing on the ledge, show the wind how to fly.  
When the world gets in my face,  
I say, have a nice day.  
Have a nice day  
Have a nice day  
  
Take a look around you, look nothing's what it seems.  
We're living in a broken home of hopes and dreams,  
Let me be the first to shake a helping hand.  
Everybody, pray enough to take a stand,  
I knocked on every door, on every dead end street,  
Looking for forgiveness,  
What's left to believe?  
  
Oh, if there's one thing I hang onto,  
It gets me through the night.  
I ain't gonna do what I don't want to,  
I'm gonna live my life.

Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.  
Have a nice day.

I can tell by your voice, baby just got burned  
I can see in your eyes, and read your lips so well  
You're a master at disguise but it ain't hard to tell  
  
Anyone that's been through it before knows that look  
I can read through your mind like a story book  
And there's no happy endings to this life  
  
Cause I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
The voices came and took advantage, now you don't want to play  
When the word got around he gave your secrets away  
Now it's too late to cry you know the damage is done  
Dry your tears say goodbye and know he wasn't the one  
  
All your life you been in and out of love  
Now you've folded your cards when push came to shove  
You're just another number, just a victim of love's lies  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night  
Calling over and over again  
  
Over and over again  
You hear the cries through the night  
Over and over...  
  
I can see the heartbreak in your eyes  
I can feel the pain that you cry deep inside of your heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the pain you hide deep inside  
Deep inside of those heartbreak eyes  
You hear the cries through the night, calling over and over  
Those heartbreak eyes  
I can feel the hurt inside your heartbreak eyes  
I can hear the cries at night, over and over again

33,Bon Jovi,Heaven Help Us,"Heaven help the child who never had a home,  
Heaven help the girl who walks the street alone  
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall,  
Heaven help us all.  
Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day,  
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away,  
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl,  
Heaven help us all.  
Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.  
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call  
Oh, yeah!  
Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one,  
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun.  
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall,

Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all.  
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call when we call.

In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep, keep hatred from the mighty,  
And the mighty from the small,  
Heaven help us all.  
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!  
Heaven help us all.

35,Bon Jovi,Hollywood Dreams,"Now I've always been a dreamer  
I've had these fantasies run through my mind  
The vivid memories of days we spent together  
They seem so long ago  
Why'd you have to leave me, why'd you let me go  
  
We're used to chasing rainbows, but they're not hard to find  
My baby used to love me, fame left it all behind  
Now I've become a prisoner, locked up behind four walls  
You say I've got life easy, but I've got no life at all  
So now I've made the grade, they know who I am  
I've made it to the top a lonely man  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Smile for the cameras is all they ever say  
Transmitting my emotions a thousand miles away  
They chase me through the streets, calling out my name  
I'm coming home to you, this life is driving me insane  
Climbing up those stairs, knocking on the door  
She don't recognize me or want me anymore  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood Dreams  
  
Those hot lights and Hollywood Dreams  
Can't bring back the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot lights and Hollywood dreams  
Can't bring back, the love that you gave to me  
Headlines and star on the rise  
I lost you chasing those Hollywood dreams  
Hot Lights  
The spot lights can't bring back you're love to me  
Chasing those Hollywood...

36,Bon Jovi,Homebound Train,"When I was just a boy  
The devil took my hand  
Took me from my home  
He made me a man  
So, don't talk to me about sympathy now  
Cause you can't dance if you  
Take a chance on your rosary  
  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On the homebound train

That I been gone  
I been everywhere, now I'm heading home  
Been a lot of girls, but  
There's a woman I know  
Said don't take no plane  
Better take a train  
Cause I like it real slow  
  
All the way back home  
On the homebound train  
I'm going down, down, down, down, down  
On the homebound train  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm heading home  
To be with my baby  
Where I belong  
Coming down the tracks now  
See, I done my time  
I'm going back now  
To that home of mine  
Well, here I come baby

Here I come baby  
  
All the way back home

38,Bon Jovi,I Am,"How you spend your minutes are what matters  
All tomorrows come from yesterdays  
When you're feeling broken, bruised and sometimes shattered  
Blow out the candles on the cake  
Like everything's a big mistake  
  
It seems you always wait for life to happen  
And your last buck can't buy a lucky break  
If all we've got is us then life's worth living  
And if you're in, you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
We're just who we are, there's no pretending  
It takes a while to learn to live in your own skin  
Say a prayer that we might find our happy ending  
And if you're in you know I'm in  
I'm ready and I'm willing  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am  
I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
  
I ain't got no halo hanging over my head  
I ain't gonna judge you, I'm just here to love you  
I am, I am  
  
Chorus: I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand  
I am

When you think that no one is there to hold your hand  
I am  
When you think that no one needs you, sees you or believes you  
No one's there to understand

I'll be there to be that someone  
When you think that no one is there to hold your hand

39,Bon Jovi,I Believe,"All I know is what I've been sold  
You can read my life like a fortune told  
I've seen the dream, there's no land of Oz  
But I got my brain and I got a heart  
And courage built I won't let go  
What we need right now is, soul  
  
I can't do this, you can't do that  
They feed us lines but I won't act  
And all good things will come to pass  
But the truth is all you have to have  
And would you lie for it?  
(Do you) cry for it?  
(Would you) die for it?  
Would you  
  
I believe, I believe  
With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a whisper to a scream  
I believe, I believe  
  
You know what you came here for  
You'll pay the cost,  
like it's your cross to bear  
Are we the ones that put it there  
Would you scheme for it  
scream for it, bleed for it  
Would you  
  
I believe, I believe  
Believe we're still worth  
The fight you'll see  
There's no hope for this world tonight  
I believe, I believe  
  
Don't look up on your movie screens  
In record stores or magazines  
Close your eyes and you will see  
That you are all you really need  
  
I believe, I believe  
With every breath that I breathe  
You and me can turn a  
whisper to a scream  
I believe, I believe

41,Bon Jovi,I Don't Want To Live Forever,"Frank Sinatra died today  
I came home and found my mama crying  
The tv had so much to say  
Somehow I was thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen and thinking about dying  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
I see my daddy in his chair  
He sits there night and day  
The tv still looks good as new  
Daddy's old and gray  
And it's scaring me to death  
I don't want to go that way  
I don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because your heart's still beating  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Gonna live while I'm alive  
You can see the glass half-empty  
You can see the glass half-full  
But all I see are shattered dreams  
Around this neighborhood  
My brother's girlfriend's pregnant  
And today she's moving in  
My friends all play the lottery  
And swear one day they'll win  
I'm seventeen, I'm thinking about dying  
I'm seventeen, no way I'm dying  
Don't want to live forever  
Just want to know that I'm alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Just until the day I die  
Just because you're breathing  
It don't mean that you're alive  
Don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever  
Don't want to live forever  
I don't want to live forever  
Nobody lives forever

42,Bon Jovi,I Got The Girl,"It feels like I'm walkin' on air  
When we walk down our street  
When the neighbors stop to watch us walk by  
You can hear 'em talking (let them talk)  
  
Sometimes I think that you're the only reason  
The sun still shines (when it shines)  
And when this wicked world starts bringing me down  
I tell myself that I'm one lucky guy  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
She says that someday she's gonna marry me  
When that day comes that we walk down the aisle  
She'll make me feel like a prince, a lord or a king  
She likes to wear her stripe with her plaids  
And she won't brush her hair (I swear)  
She don't like wearing shoes in December  
But I don't care (I don't care)  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
If I was a holy man I'd get down on my knees  
So the angels that watch over her would give a break to me  
Holy Mother of saint bubble gum and sister band-aid knees  
Won't you please pray for the ones like me  
  
But the truth is someday  
Somebody is gonna take her (you see)  
But the queen of hearts will always be  
A five-year-old princess to me (to me)  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the girl (with all the cards)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (who's gonna break my heart)  
  
I got the girl (she's gonna leave her mark)  
I got the girl (she's a work of art)  
I got the girl (she's gonna break your heart)

43,Bon Jovi,I Wish Every Day Could Be Like Christmas,"What time is it baby? Is it that time again?  
When snow will be falling, friends will be calling  
You know it's time when there'll be carolers singing Silent Night  
I love when they sing, the feeling it brings  
It's warm as a fire is bright  
  
Soon there'll be toys for the good girls and boys  
And reindeer are heading our way  
Yes, and Santa will come down the chimney above  
There's one thing I wanted to say  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
I saw a child sit with old Mr. Claus  
Looked him in the eye and he asked old Santa what peace on earth was  
Now the old man grew cautious on how he would say  
That is the greatest gift, one you can give everyday  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
  
Now the mistle-toe and the house a-glow  
All the world seems at ease tonight  
And all that I ask when these precious moments pass  
Is why can't every day be so bright?  
  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas  
And if I could have one wish come true  
I wish everyday could be full of peace and harmony  
I wish everyday could be like Christmas, I do  
Honest I do, yes I do now  
Very merry Christmas

44,Bon Jovi,If That's What It Takes,"I played the part of a broken heart upon a shelf  
I played that part so lonely and so well  
Thought that love belonged to someone else not me and you  
Yeah, I know that you've been shattered , you been bruised  
We both know what it feels like when you lose  
But I'd bet my life on the roll of the dice for you  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
I bet you counted all the tears I bet you've cried  
I bet you swore you'd never let love back inside  
'Cause it hurt you way too bad to say good-bye  
Now, there'll be times when I might put us to the test  
And it's hard for broken hearts to just forget  
But I'm driving blind, I'll lay it all on the line for you  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonite 's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
So, when you feel like jumping,  
Just when your heart starts pumping  
When you're standing out on that ledge-staring over the edge  
I'll be there to talk you down, I'll be there before you hit the ground  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
Tonight's the night, I'm gonna prove it to you  
Do I have to break down, baby just to break through  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If that's what it takes  
  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do  
If we take the time to do it right, I know we'll pull through  
If it took all my life, I'd prove it to you  
If that's what it takes, that's what I'd do

I heard your suitcase say goodbye.  
And as my broken heart lies bleeding,  
they say true love is suicide.  
  
You say you've cried a thousand rivers,  
and now you're swimming for the shore.  
You left me drowning in my tears,  
and you won't save me anymore.  
Now I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance, girl.  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.

I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for you  
  
I know you know we've had some good times,  
Now they have their own hiding place.  
I can promise you tomorrow,  
But I can't buy back yesterday.  
  
And baby you know my hands are dirty,  
But I wanted to be your Valentine,  
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby  
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for you  
  
And I wasn't there when you were happy,  
I wasn't there when you were down.  
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby  
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
Steal the sun from the sky for you,  
Words can't say what love can do.  
I'll be there for...  
  
I'll be there for you  
These five words I swear to you.  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you.  
I'll be there for you

"
47,Bon Jovi,I'm With You,"Look at this world  
It's filled with worn out places  
Forgotten faces  
And nothing changes  
  
Whatever happened  
To that new day rising  
We're just surviving  
And living is dying  
  
Are you tired  
Of being let down  
Another day  
Another shakedown  
  
I'm with you  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
when it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
I'm with you  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
I walk in shadows  
That seem all familiar  
I've read the papers  
A life forsaken  
  
A mumble some from  
I'm one more for sale sign  
Down on Main street  
You just walk by  
  
How many times you gotta  
Break down  
Before somebody's  
Gonna shout out  
I'm with you  
  
We hope is gone  
All you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
I'm with you  
  
If I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
  
When hope is gone  
And all you want is the truth  
(I'm with you)  
You carry on  
When it seems no use  
It seems no use, It seems no use  
  
When I got one thing  
I got something to prove  
We all got nothing  
If there's nothing to lose  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)  
(I'm with you)

48,Bon Jovi,Imagine,"Imagine there's no heaven,  
It's easy if you try,  
No hell below us,  
Above us only sky,  
Imagine all the people  
Living for today...  
  
Imagine there's no countries,  
It isn't hard to do,  
Nothing to kill or die for,  
No religion too,  
Imagine all the people  
Living life in peace...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.  
  
Imagine no possesions,  
I wonder if you can,  
No need for greed or hunger,  
A brotherhood of man,  
Imagine all the people  
Sharing all the world...  
  
You may say I'm a dreamer,  
But I'm not the only one,  
I hope some day you'll join us,  
And the world will live as one.

They burn with fire, Yeah, until the end of time.

Our words were our songs.  
Our songs are our prayers.

This whole place still smells like your cheap perfume.  
Everything here reminds me of you.  
There's nothing I wouldn't do.  
And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.  
  
I'd hold you, I'd need you,

That faded rose that's all dried out  
Those bukowski poems we couldn't live without  
Your high school pic when you had wild hair  
That stormy day on the beach that got us here

Can't you see...

Standing right behind you should you fall  
Ill be the one to hold you up to walk  
When this wicked world makes us want to crawl

52,Bon Jovi,Just Older,"Hey, man, it's been a while  
Do you remember me?  
When I hit the streets I was 17  
A little wild, a little green  
  
I've been up and down and in between  
After all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing that dream  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
I like the bed I'm sleeping in  
It's just like me, it's broken in  
It's not old -- just older  
Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans  
This skin I'm in it's alright with me  
It's not old -- just older  
  
It's good to see your face  
You ain't no worse for wear  
Breathing that California air  
When we took on the world  
When we were young and brave  
We got secrets that we'll take to the grave  
And we're standing here shoulder to shoulder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not old enough to sing the blues  
But I wore the holes in the soles of these shoes  
You can roll the dice 'til they call your bluff  
But you can't win until you're not afraid to lose  
  
Well, I look in the mirror  
I don't hate what I see  
There's a few more lines staring back at me  
The nights have grown a little colder  
Hey man, I gotta run  
Now you take care  
  
If you see coach T. Tell him I cut my hair  
It's been all these years  
Can you believe I'm still chasing dreams  
But I ain't looking over my shoulder

53,Bon Jovi,Justice In The Barrel,"Hey mister can you help me  
I'm a loner on the run  
I'm just looking for tomorrow  
And I ain't gonna hurt no one  
  
I jumped headfirst into a bottle  
I was looking for a friend  
Came up just short of nothing  
I didn't find the truth I only found an end  
  
So tell me who's gonna save me  
Or my father or my son  
When the only justice a man can see  
Is the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
I been broke and I've been hungry  
I think they're both my middle name  
But I don't never ever never seem to get enough  
Still guess I can't complain  
  
'Cause what you get in life you take it  
You've gotta hold on and make it last  
They say good things come to those who wait  
But it's life that goes so fast  
  
And when there's just one rule you live by  
Each day you kiss the rising sun  
When you live and die by the life we breathe  
In the barrel of a loaded gun  
  
Guns talk to me in my sleep at night  
And a gun somewhere is burning  
With my name  
  
Winners are losers  
And losers will have to face  
All those yesterdays  
And all of the dreams they blew away  
  
So mister can you help me  
Or are you my gun  
Have the ghosts of justice  
Brought you here to me to taste  
The barrel of a loaded gun  
  
There's justice in the barrel  
Of a loaded gun

54,Bon Jovi,Kidnap An Angel,"I get up every morning, drink coffee alone  
My house it's too quiet, I'm the only one home  
I let the newspapers pile up at the door  
I can't be bothered, I don't read 'em no more  
The flowers are blooming, that you planted last spring  
I can't make much sense out of anything  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
  
I get in the car like I do every day  
Wondering how in the world did it turn out this way?  
It's just 'round the corner, turn left and I'm there  
I'd do anything to be anywhere but here  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel  
  
Now the parking attendant knows my first name  
These long green hallways all look the same  
There's four elevators, one goes to that floor  
I brace myself when I get to the door  
I close my eyes and take a deep breath  
Then sit down beside your hospital bed  
  
If I could kidnap an angel, I'd clip off his wings  
And bring them to you that would fix everything  
If I could kidnap an angel he could teach us to fly  
We'd live forever, forever, we'd never die  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel  
  
He'd say the word, he'd tear down these walls  
People laughing like children through these hospital halls  
There'd be no more tears, there'd be no more blood  
There'd be nothing but smiles, nothing but love  
If I could kidnap an angel, if I could kidnap an angel

55,Bon Jovi,Last Chance Train,"October leaves are falling, so am I  
A harvest moon is calling me and I know why  
The traffic's like a symphony in blue  
  
In the autumn air I smell your sweet perfume  
I miss you sitting cross legged in this empty room  
Yesterdays are eating me alive  
  
I'm your angel, baby  
I've got broken wings  
I can't walk, I can't run, I can't drop  
Until you're next to me, so the only thing  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
You try to reach me but I've sailed away  
You tried to read me but my words got in the way  
The music's over but the dance has just begun  
  
I wish that I could just get back to Baltimore  
You know I'd scratch, I'd claw, I'd scream  
Till I'm raw, just to fall down at your door  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that don't come back  
'Cause the train has left the station with my pain  
Let them forget my name, oh  
  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Sitting here I smoke my nineteenth cigarette  
Now all that's left are ashes, butts and my regrets  
It's your taste that I just can't forget  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
  
Let the scarecrows laugh coming down the tracks  
At the broken hearts that don't come back  
We'll be laughing at them, crying in the rain  
It's you and I again, oh  
  
You gotta meet me tonight  
I'm on a last chance train  
Leave a flower at the station  
I know my destination  
Love bring me home again  
  
I'm on a last chance train  
It's gonna bring me home to you  
Oh, the last chance train  
Coming through, my babe  
This time I'm coming through  
Coming through

Looking down, there was no net  
Now, I'm standing at your door

Too late to cover up my tracks  
Damn the fool who begs for more  
Ill take my past and paint it black

This clown has got to get his feet back on the ground

Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
Now I'm learning how to fall  
Yeah, I got the hang of it  
  
I was standing in the light  
There were faces all around  
I put my gloves up for a fight  
One sucker punch and I was down  
  
I'm learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
I'm learning how to fall  
Yeah, I got the hang of it  
  
I was flying through the clouds  
Pucker up, its time to kiss the ground

Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all

To a pawn on a Christmas Day

Say God is dead and war's begun.

It's hard believing that the thrill is gone  
But we got to go around again, so let's hold on

'Cause baby you're the one thing I believe  
Let it all fall down around us, if that's what's meant to be

60,Bon Jovi,Life's Too Short For Days Like These,"Needed a car, looked around for a week  
For two dollars down I signed my name on the lease  
There was a knock on my door, old man wants his keys  
All he said was something about bankruptcy  
  
Oh no, here we go  
There ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
  
Minding my own business in a restaurant  
Trying to get some dinner but then guess what?  
Some chick got there I slept with, threw her drink in my face  
And then her ugly brother kicked my ass all over the place  
  
Oh no, here we go  
Ain't no day that's different from the day you know that  
Life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days like these  
Too short baby  
  
I met her last night at quarter to three  
I couldn't believe that she came home with me  
Woke up this morning scratching now I know when to leave  
They say you lay down with dogs, you wake up with fleas  
  
You know that life's too short for days like these  
Try to close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days like these  
Seems like lately baby it's all trick or treat  
I'd get up and dance if I could get on my feet  
  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days  
Life's too short for days like these  
  
Life's too short for days like these  
Wish I could close my eyes and just go back to sleep  
It's hard to keep running when you're down on your knees  
Cause life's too short  
You know that life's too short for days like these  
They say life's too short

You been used  
You been crucified and  
You been abused  
You been sacrificed and  
Now you're confused  
Ain't it the truth  
  
You got a hole in your head  
And a cold empty spot  
In your big brass bed

Kicked through the mud

Haven't found the drug  
To pick us up  
  
Feeling down, misunderstood  
You know these times  
They ain't looking so good  
When you're mad at the world and  
You feel like you're losing control  
What we all need to get by is  
A little o soul  
  
Whoa oh  
Little bit of soul  
What we all need  
To survive  
Is just  
A little bit o soul  
  
Everyone's complaining  
Nothing but frustration  
The king has pissed in  
Your pot of gold  
It ain't entertaining spending  
So much time in the hole  
Send down  
A little bit o soul  
  
When you're mad at the world  
And you feel like  
You're losing control  
What we all need  
To get by is just

But Im feeling lonely tonight  
Damn, I got my last cigarette  
But I aint got not light

I hear that fire in your eyes  
Is on the rock and doing hard time  
  
And the grapes of wrath, theyre on the vine  
Theres wine in this dirt  
Here love aint love  
Its just another four letter word  
  
God let these wheels roll  
To where the girls are pretty  
When the nights explode  
And life is still living  
Down this open road  
The arms of pity  
Wait to greet me tonight in little city  
  
Now that cold gray fogs  
Just a rolling down the highway  
Hes come to carry me home  
Its put a little smile on my face

63,Bon Jovi,Living In Sin,"I don't need no license  
To sign on no line  
And I don't need no preacher  
To tell me you're mine  
I don't need no diamonds  
I don't need no new bride  
I just need you, baby  
To look me in the eye  
I know they have a hard time  
And your Daddy don't approve  
But I don't need you Daddy  
Telling us what we should do  
  
Now there's a million questions  
I could ask about our lives  
But I only need one answer  
To get me thought the night  
So, I say  
  
Baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me  
Or just this world we live in  
I say we're living on love  
They say we're living in sin  
  
Is it right for both our parents  
Who fight it out most nights  
Then pray for God's forgiveness  
When they both turn out the lights  
Or wear that ring of diamonds  
When you heart is made of stone  
You can talk but still say nothing  
You stay together but alone  
  
Or is it right to hold you  
And kiss your lips goodnight  
They say the promise is forever  
If you sign it on the dotted line  
  
Oh baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I say we're living on love  
They say we're living in sin  
  
Baby, can you tell me  
Just where we fit in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
Is it you and me or  
Just this world we live in  
I call it love  
They call it living in sin  
I don't know where to begin  
I don't know where we fit in  
Living in sin

64,Bon Jovi,Lonely At The Top,"Tell Franie I'm sorry she didn't get to know her dad  
I'll bet he's sorry he didn't get to know you too  
Tell her there'll be people singing things that make her sad  
How her daddy felt alone how he was hurtin' bad  
I guess that won't be too far from the truth  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy is one thing it's not.  
  
I was jaded, suffocated, it got too hard to breath  
But I never got as high as I needed to be  
You know life becomes worthless when they steal your dreams  
I just couldn't live with what was left for me  
And I couldn't run far enough from the truth, what's the use  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy's one thing it's not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there can help you stop before you hit the ground  
It's lonely at the top ooh yeah  
  
Tell Franie, I'm sorry I better kiss her when she cries  
I'm sorry I left her, never said good bye  
Didn't mean to leave you all alone but then the music died  
Through the song remains the same, I couldn't live that lie  
You know that ain't too far from the truth  
  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Happy's one thing it's not  
  
Before you know you find yourself alone and looking down  
No one there to help you stop before you hit the ground  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
Yeah, it's lonely at the top  
It's lonely

65,Bon Jovi,Lonely Is The Night,"I need someone, I need somebody to be a friend,  
I'm not alone, but still I'm lonely in the end  
She was runnin' away on the 9 o'clock train, so very far from home,  
With a head full of schemes, a handful of dreams  
I was on my own  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
What can I do, what can I say, to get her back,  
Alone I wait before my train comes runnin' down the tracks  
Heaven knows that I'd wait if God were to say that you would come  
I guess you can say it's the price that you pay for holdin' on  
  
I know you're out there, I know you're there  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
Lonely, lonely is the night  
  
If you want me, if you need me, I'll be there,  
If you want me, please believe me, I'll be waiting

66,Bon Jovi,Lost Highway,"Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
In my rearview mirror  
My life is getting clearer  
The sunset sighs and slowly disappears  
These trinkets once were treasure  
Life changes like the weather  
You grow up, grow old, or you hit the road 'round here  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Watching white lines passing by  
With my plastic dashboard Jesus  
Waiting there to greet us  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, hey  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
Yeah, I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
Out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey, hey  
Hey, hey  
  
Don't know where I'm going  
But I know where I've been  
I'm afraid of going back again  
So I drive (Drive, drive)  
Years and miles are flying by  
And waiting there to greet us  
Is my plastic dashboard Jesus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh patron saint of lonely souls  
Tell this boy which way to go  
Guide the car, you've got the keys  
Farewell to mediocrity  
Kicking off the cruise control  
And turning up the radio  
Got just enough religion  
And a half a tank of gas  
Come on  
Let's go  
  
I finally found my way  
Said goodbye to yesterday  
Hit the gas, there ain't no brakes on this lost highway  
I'm busting loose, I'm lettin' go  
When I'm out on this open road  
It's independence day on this lost highway  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
On this lost highway

67,Bon Jovi,Lucky,"She counts the days away and waits for valentines  
She says every girl in the past is just a waste of time  
You know, whoa  
She don't believe in miracles and make-believe  
If you were blind you still could see  
That she believes in me, Oh  
Feels like I found a pocket full of gold  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say ""I'm lucky baby""  
So lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky  
  
Now all of heaven's angels have to wear their wings  
She likes cheap sunglasses and diamond rings  
You know, oh  
She brings sunshine to a cloudy day  
When we walk on by people stop and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky baby  
So lucky baby  
Lucky to be with you today  
Lucky to be the one to say ""I'm lucky baby""  
I'm lucky baby  
  
I got lucky when you found me  
It only took one kiss to see  
What did I do to get to be so lucky baby?

I'm lucky baby  
Whenever I see your smiling face  
Lucky to be the one to be lucky

68,Bon Jovi,Maybe Tomorrow,"Seems like years since I've been home  
Living this dream on the endless roads  
Faces in the crowd, they stare at me  
Yours is the only one I wanted to see  
My heart cries out for sympathy  
But I need to hold you next to me  
And it won't be long, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
These hotel rooms they're all the same  
Only the number on the door will be changed  
Lord I gotta do me one more show  
Then it's into the bus and off we go  
Should have talked to you  
Well I don't have to try  
When I find the music in your eyes  
And I'm telling myself that we'll take that ride, baby  
Maybe tomorrow  
I should've talked to you  
Well I don't got to try  
Where I can find the music in your eyes  
We're all blind, two lovers, into the night  
Maybe tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Tomorrow  
Maybe tomorrow

69,Bon Jovi,Misunderstood,"Should I? Could I?  
Have said the wrong things right a thousand times  
If I could just rewind, I see it in my mind  
If I could turn back time, you'd still be mine  
  
You cried, I died  
I should have shut my mouth, things headed south  
As the words slipped off my tongue, they sounded dumb  
If this old heart could talk, it'd say you're the one  
I'm wasting time when I think about it  
  
[Chorus:]  
I should have drove all night,  
I would have run all the lights  
I was misunderstood  
I stumbled like my words,  
Did the best I could  
Damn, misunderstood  
  
Could I? Should I?  
Apologize for sleeping on the couch that night  
Staying out too late with all my friends  
You found me passed out in the yard again  
  
You cried, I tried  
To stretch the truth, but didn't lie  
It's not so bad when you think about it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Intentions good  
  
It's you and I, just think about it  
  
I should have drove all night  
I would have run all the lights  
I was misunderstood  
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could  
I 'm hanging outside your door  
I've been here before  
Misunderstood  
  
I stumbled like my words, did the best I could  
Damn, misunderstood  
Intentions good.

70,Bon Jovi,No Regrets,"Thunder cracks, the sky is crying  
On her back she's pushing trying  
He holds her hand and kneels beside her bed  
Break the silence baby screaming  
In slow motion she ain't dreaming she closed her eyes looked  
Up to God and says  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
Living's hard and dying's easy  
My mistakes they won't defeat me  
I like to burn the candle at both ends  
I've broke some hearts been broken hearted  
I've run away from fires I've started  
I didn't break but tried my best to bend  
  
Chorus  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets  
  
No regrets-for things I've done  
No regrets-for wars I've won  
No regrets-for fires I've started  
No regrets-for faith departed  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I die a little more  
Should I lie a little more  
Should I get high a little more  
  
Should I cry a little more  
Should I try a little more  
I'd pay the cost and laugh it off  
I'd do it all a thousand times again  
No Regrets

But it's all right

Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down  
Tonight, If Gina says it's all right  
  
I'm gonna see those senoritas lying under the sun

You know I want to be their blanket, gonna tell every girl  
Hey baby you're the one

I got a party in my pocket,  
And you know I just got paid  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade.  
  
When the sun goes down, that's when the street heats up  
Senorita, margarita, fills your empty cup tonight  
She makes me feel so right  
A good time here doesn't cost much money  
Just a little sweet talking, let the pretties in the party  
And you're set for life  
Or one hell of a night  
  
I can see those sons of beaches  
Out there livin' it up  
In the surf and the sand,  
Man, that life ain't so tough  
So get me in the action  
Let me tell every girl she's the one

Youre beautiful  
There comes a time in someones life  
When you find things that matter

The love runs deep  
We realize it's our to keep  
And that's all that really matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters

Aint no me without you.

Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true

74,Bon Jovi,Amen,"Amen  
Last night I had a dream  
The dream I had was true  
I fell through the stars  
Went walking on the moon  
Burned like a thousand candles in her arms  
  
The skin under my finger tips  
Honeysuckle on her lips  
Sweeter than a man deserves to taste  
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say?  
  
But amen, amen, amen  
  
Last night we were born together  
It was like we'd always been  
She'll be with me forever  
If I don't see her again  
We poured the wine until our cup ran over  
  
Unfolding like the mystery  
Inside of her like poetry  
A thousand horses running through my veins  
Mercy, mercy what else can I say  
  
Amen, amen, amen  
  
I laid down in her garden  
Naked on her floor  
Windows up, the curtains blowing  
She don't lock the door  
  
Amen, amen  
  
At the banquet table  
A beggar at a feast  
I felt her tongue between her lips  
And I forgot to breath  
We stayed there 'til the candles burned the carpet  
  
Last night I had a dream  
The dream I had was true  
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say  
Mercy, mercy, I laid down and prayed  
  
Amen, amen  
Amen, amen

It was another day  
A perfect texas afternoon  
A mother and two children play  
The way they always do  
As they raced home from the mailbox  
A mother and her son  
Against a little girl of 6 years old  
The independant one  
  
The deputies went door to door  
Through all the neighborhood  
They said I got some news to tell you folks  
I'm afraid it aint so good  
Somehow something happened  
Someone got away  
Someone got the answers for what happened here today  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
Now the people from the papers and the local tv news  
Tried to find the reason  
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues  
Someone shouted hit and run  
The coroner cried foul  
Her blue dress was what she wore  
The day they laid her body down  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean

Up on heavens highest hill  
And no one there can hurt you baby  
No one ever will

How you gonna sleep again

Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
  
It's a shame when they say that's it's been done and said  
they keep digging that grave,let them bury their heads  
there's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars  
there's another first kiss, in the back of some car  
Turn the page and write the story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in

From some johnny on the spot  
Who said hey keep the change baby  
  
Billy get your guns  
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
That's the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And it'll never change  
  
They christened you with whiskey  
And there's fire running through your veins  
Well you're an outlaw just the same  
And every night a bullet wears your name  
  
I've seen hangman dancing  
Beneath the pale moonlight  
Billy get your guns  
And every stranger that you meet  
Thinks it's his lucky night  
Billy get your guns  
  
I don't envy you billy  
But I want to say  
You better get your guns  
'cause every outlaw that's died  
Will live to ride again  
Billy get your guns  
  
Billy get your guns  
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
That's the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And it'll never change  
Billy get your guns

80,Bon Jovi,Blaze Of Glory,"I wake up in the morning  
And I raise my weary head  
I've got an old coat for a pillow  
And the earth was last night's bed  
I don't know where I'm going  
Only God knows where I've been  
I'm a devil on the run  
A six gun lover  
A candle in the wind  
  
When you're brought into this world  
They say you're born in sin  
Well at least they gave me something  
I didn't have to steal or have to win  
Well they tell me that I'm wanted  
Yeah, I'm a wanted man  
I'm a colt in your stable  
I'm what Cain was to Abel  
Mister catch me if you can  
  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
I'm no one's son  
Call me young gun  
  
You ask about my conscience  
And I offer you my soul  
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man  
Well I ask if I'll grow old  
You ask me if I've known love  
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain  
Well, I've seen love come  
And I've seen it shot down  
I've seen it die in vain  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
I'm the devil's son  
Call me young gun  
  
Each night I go to bed  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
No I ain't looking for forgiveness  
But before I'm six foot deep  
Lord, I got to ask a favor  
And hope you'll understand  
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest  
Let this boy die like a man  
Staring down a bullet  
Let me make my final stand  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
And I'm no one's son  
Call me young gun  
I'm a young gun  
Young gun, yeah yeah yeah  
Young gun

81,Bon Jovi,Blood On Blood,"I can still remember  
When I was just a kid  
When friends were friends forever  
And what you said was what you did  
  
Well, it was me and Dan and Bobby  
We cut each other's hands  
And held tight to a promise  
Only brothers understand  
  
But we were so young (so young)  
One for all and all for one (for one)  
Just as sure as the river's gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing  
When all was said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And I'll be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Well, Bobby was our hero  
Cause he hed a fake I.D.  
I got busted stealing cigarettes  
And he took the rap for me  
  
Danny knew this white trash girl  
We each threw in a ten  
She took us to this cheap motel  
And turned us into men  
  
We were so young (so young)  
One for all and all for one (for one)  
Just as sure as the river's gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing  
When all is said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And I'll be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer  
Danny, he's a medicin man  
And me, I'm just the singer  
In a long haired rock'n'roll band  
  
Through the years and miles between us  
It's been a long and lonely ride  
But if I got a call in the dead of the night  
I'd be right by your side  
  
Blood on blood, blood on blood  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing

82,Bon Jovi,Borderline,"You call every hour, but there's nothing to say  
So talk to me now, before it's too late  
Oh they say it couldn't happen, but I saw your picture breathe  
That fifty dollar doctor said your love is a disease  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
Still I don't know how, and I don't know why  
But the talk turns to shop, and so we stand on the edge of goodbye  
Is this the end of the beginning, or beginning of an end  
Are you friend or the enemy, or enemy or the friend  
I walk the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right  
Borderline  
The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
I hear talk on the streets, I hear rumors of you  
The people I meet say, that the lies are all true  
And I wake up in a cold sweat, find you lying fast asleep  
Is my dream a reality, reality a dream  
I've crossed the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right  
Borderline  
The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right

The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline

83,Bon Jovi,Breathe,"I guess this time you're really leaving  
I heard your suitcase say goodbye  
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding  
You say true love is suicide  
You say you've cried a thousand rivers  
And now you're swimming for the shore  
You left me drowning in my tears  
And you won't save me anymore  
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for you  
  
I know you know we've had some good times  
Now they have their own hiding place  
Well I can promise you tomorrow  
But I can't buy back yesterday  
And baby you know my hands are dirty  
But I wanted to be your Valentine  
I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby  
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for you  
  
I wasn't there when you were happy  
And I wasn't there when you were down  
Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby  
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you

84,Bon Jovi,Brokenpromiseland,"Angels falling from the sky  
Imagine that imagine that  
Nobody's getting out of here alive  
No turning back no turning back  
Who's going to bail out all our shattered dreams?  
And scrape some truth off of these city streets  
No time for praying get up off your knees  
  
[Chorus]  
There's hope I know  
Out on that lonely road  
'Cause home is where you are and where I am  
Breathe in, breathe out  
There's only now  
And all I got I'm holding in my hands  
We're breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
  
Let's close our eyes and just disappear  
Slip through the cracks no looking back  
We'll get a million miles away from here  
And let the past just fade to black  
So what you learn to live with your regrets  
No need to fear what hasn't happened yet  
Life will get you but you can't forget

So rise my fallen angel  
Come on now come on now  
Shine, don't let 'em break you

Filled with desire  
I can't stand the heat  
My heart's on fire  
I can't get enough  
It's down to the wire  
Making my move, I'm looking for you  
I'm burning for love  
  
You're the victim it's in your eyes  
I'm the suspect and love's the crime  
Tensions mounting bodies shaking  
I can't take the anticipation

Now that I got you in my sight  
Can't take another sleepless night  
Oh, no, no  
You can run but you can't hide  
You're the only one I need  
To feel the fire inside

Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
some things are meant to be  
take my hand, take my whole life too

87,Bon Jovi,Celluloid Heroes,"Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star,  
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.  
There are stars in every city,  
In every house and on every street,  
And if you walk down hollywood boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete!  
  
Don't step on greta garbo as you walk down the boulevard,  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne,  
But she turned her back on stardom,  
Because she wanted to be alone.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
Rudolph valentino, looks very much alive,  
And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by.  
Avoid stepping on bela lugosi  
'cos he's liable to turn and bite,  
But stand close by bette davis  
Because hers was such a lonely life.  
If you covered him with garbage,  
George sanders would still have style,  
And if you stamped on mickey rooney  
He would still turn round and smile,  
But please don't tread on dearest marilyn  
'cos she's not very tough,  
She should have been made of iron or steel,  
But she was only made of flesh and blood.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of.  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
  
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.  
  
And those who are successful,  
Be always on your guard,  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along hollywood boulevard.  
  
I wish my life was a non-stop hollywood movie show,  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk along hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
  
Oh celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
Oh celluloid heroes never really die.  
  
I wish my life was a non-stop hollywood movie show,  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die.

Hey, whats this feeling  
I've never been down this far before  
I was scared of believing  
That love would never find my door  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew I was supposed to be  
Waiting for someone to come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me.  
Hey am I dreaming?  
I never woke up from night before  
Unaware I was bleeding  
Slowly dying like the sun  
Going down once more.  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me.  
Alone in the darkness  
Til saw the light  
Shining from your eyes  
Now it burns inside and it keeps me alive  
Lord I've been chained  
I've been chained, yeah.  
Was chained  
Chained  
Chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew who supposed to be  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
I've been chained  
Chained  
I've been chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Waiting for you to come and rescue me  
Hoping that someone would come and  
Rescue me

You put your head down on my chest  
To hear my breath  
  
Go on, take my last breath from me  
I don't want to live no more  
And cut my eyes so I can't see  
I can't see you looking back as you walk out the door

Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
I was a lover lost in sea  
You found me washed up on the beach  
You took me home, you gave me breakfast  
I said Id offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
Cold, cold heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
What are you hiding underneath that shirt  
If youre the one to run babe  
Then you don't feel the hurt  
  
Her hair so brown, and eyes so green  
You used to say I made good company  
Shed bring me wine and sip her tea  
Then youd give yourself what you could give to me  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Cold, cold heart  
Your cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Whats it gonna take

90,Bon Jovi,Crazy Love,"The city sounds like a symphony  
A cabbie screams obscenities  
The horns are honking jazz in the night  
The street is lit like a Christmas tree  
This place its my amphetamine  
She junks me but its alright  
In her summer dress she parts the sea  
Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads  
Everybody else is gone but her and me  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
Sittin' on my stoop I lit one up  
Hit the ashes in my coffee cup  
And watch the world passin' me by  
Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart  
Ain't it funny how life imitates art?  
Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight  
  
But when she's walkin' down the street  
The sidewalks there to kiss her feet  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
She needs me, pleads me  
And wraps me in her loving charm  
She'll tease me, squeeze me  
But I'm the man when I'm in her arms  
  
Now the angels sing a melody  
They wrote for her explicitly  
And no one hears but her and me  
  
Now wait a minute  
Wait, I can't believe my eyes  
Who's that comin' round the corner?  
Oh she's lookin' fine ain't she?  
Get out the way!  
No, no, no, no, no get out the way!  
Oh look at those high heel sneakers  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes

Now, you've got me on your string... Diamond ring

96,Bon Jovi,Don't Do That To Me Anymore,"If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times  
You can't go on playing with people's minds  
But you lied thinking that you'd get by  
Breaking hearts one by one in a line  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
So don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
I can count the times you really made me a fool  
I guess what we've got was a different set of rules  
Well you cried, thinking that I'd breakdown  
But I'm not sure I need you hanging around  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
You wont have me to kick around anymore  
I'm not a fool for you and that's for sure  
No reason left for you to try to pretend  
I told you before now I'll say it again  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore

97,Bon Jovi,Don't Keep Me Wondering,"When I come home, it's late, I feel so all alone  
What was my mistake, baby, why don't you care at all?  
Well if it's just a change in you, I'll adjust,  
But if you're true give me a sign of your trust,  
And am I supposed to be true to you.  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', if you've given up  
  
When I come to bed, you're there, but I feel so all alone  
What can I do, short of sleepin' on the floor  
I might be slow girl but I'm not dumb  
The question arises, am I the only one?  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't you keep me baby

99,Bon Jovi,Don't You Believe Him,"I know it's been a long time, since I called you last  
Remember all those dreams that we had, the time went by so damn fast  
You said I had to flaunt those girls I kept by my sides for kicks  
You let the rumors fly, it's nothing new  
What those little boys will do to get their fix  
  
You broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Since you left me baby, since you gone and stole my heart  
I remember the very night that I broke down and fell apart  
Girl you don't remember, what I'm up here to be  
Baby, baby don't you know, you're the biggest part of me  
  
It broke my heart when you said good bye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)

100,Bon Jovi,Drift Away,"Day after day I get more confused  
Trying to see the light  
In the morning rain  
Going on a game  
You have to lose  
'Cause the feeling's changed  
I won't lose again  
  
CHORUS 1  
Giving the people  
As I pray my soul  
I wanna get lost in rock'n'roll  
And drift away  
  
Sometimes I think  
I've always been down  
I don't understand the things I see  
The world outside seems so unkind  
So unkind  
But I'm dependin' on you to let it  
See me through  
  
REPEAT CHORUS 1

"
101,Bon Jovi,Drive,"Baby, I've been thinking, it's too hard to speak these nights,  
Can I confess what's on my chest, what's really on my mind.  
See, I never was scared of nothing, there was nothing that we couldn't do,  
We used to think that we could walk on water, just because we wanted to.  
And it all seemed so easy, when we were living not just alive,  
We talked about dreams, and how we would like to spend our lives.  
  
When freedom was a tank of gas, on a long summer night,  
To drive, just drive.  
  
Can you keep a secret baby, if you can't, just lie,  
Yeah, I want to scream, when I have this dream, that my whole life passed me  
By.  
And they sold my heart for diamonds, and they sold some pride for gold,  
There's lots of things that I can't get back, that the record company owns.  
When 17 has turned 30, it's all gone kiss it goodbye.  
Hey baby, maybe we aint kids no more, but I'm too young to die.  
  
There's still some freedom in this tank of gas, if you're by my side,  
We'll drive, just drive.  
  
Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, with you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board.  
We'll drive, with the radio on.  
  
You can lean your head on my shoulder, and just for a while,  
Forget about the world, baby, mile after mile.  
We'll drive, all night long yeah, you want a ride?  
  
No airplane, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, and you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board,  
We'll drive, with the radio on baby all right.

"
102,Bon Jovi,Dry County,"Across the border they turn water into wine  
Some say it's the devil's blood  
They're squeezing from the vine  
Some say it's a savior  
In these hard and desperate times  
You see it helps me to forget that we're just born  
To die  
  
I came here like so many did to find a better life  
To find my piece of easy street  
To finally be alive  
And I know nothing good comes easy  
All good things take some time  
I made my bed I'll lie in it  
To die in it's the crime  
  
You can't help but prosper  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
They say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybody's known  
Now I packed up on my wife and kid  
And left them both back at home  
See there's nothing in this pay dirt  
The ghosts are all I know  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive (Not this time)  
  
""In the blessed name of Jesus"" I heard a preacher say  
That we are all God's children  
And He'd be back, back someday  
I hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wine  
I didn't have too good a feeling as I head out to the night  
  
I cursed the sky to open  
I begged the clouds for rain  
I prayed all night for water  
For this burning in my veins  
It was like my soul's on fire  
And I had to watch the flames  
All my dreams went up in ashes  
And my future blew away  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash these sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive  
  
Men spend their whole lives waiting  
Prayin' for some big reward  
But it seems sometimes the payoff  
Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore  
If I could choose the way I'd die  
Make it by the gun or knife  
'Cause the other way there's too much pain  
Night after night after night after night  
  
Down in dry county  
Where they're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
In dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
No one's getting out of here  
Dry county  
And no one's getting out of here  
Dry county

103,Bon Jovi,Dyin' Ain't Much Of A Livin',"A whiskey bottle comforts me  
And tells me not to cry  
While a full moon says a prayer for me  
I try to close my eyes  
  
But the night's there to remind me  
Of the guns and the early graves  
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep  
To sing an outlaw's serenade  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
The desert's been a friend to me  
It covers me by night  
And a snakebite's not my enemy  
But it taught me how to fight  
  
All this fame don't bring you freedom  
Though it wears a this disguise  
When an outlaw is just a man to me  
And a man has to die  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
And I hope someone will pray for me  
When it's my turn to die, pray for me  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

104,Bon Jovi,Edge Of A Broken Heart,"And there I stood, just like a soldier  
I was tough, until I saw her  
I said hello, but she just turned away  
  
Hey romeo, whatcha doin with my girl,  
Who are you using now, well I turn and walk away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im gonna please her, now you can believe it

Youre with him, whos on the wrong side now  
Do you still think of me  
  
Ive tried to call, but no one answers  
Two silhouettes, a private dancer  
Lights go dim, as the music starts to fade, away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im the one who needs you, now you can believe it  
Ill be there to catch you when you fall  
  
Ooo you better believe Im the man (on the edge of a broken heart)

105,Bon Jovi,Every Beat Of My Heart,"As a hard rain beats down in the night  
It sounds like applause  
Still I can't hear a sound  
With the beat of my heart  
  
I can't pick up that phone anymore  
And I need to confess  
If I don't say, ""I love you""  
Everything else is a waste of my breathe  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
To live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
As I whisper your name  
I wish you were here by my side  
And the only way that I find you  
Is when I close my eyes  
  
With my ring on your finger  
I hope and I pray  
That you know deep in your soul  
With every step that you take  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
I live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
It's the little things that you do  
That make me want you more  
It's the way your hands are trembling  
But what they trembling for?  
  
It's the way the smile fits on your lips  
The way you hold me tight  
God knows I'd give everything  
To be in your arms tonight  
  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give every beat of my heart just to live  
Every beat of my heart, just to live  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
To die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart

106,Bon Jovi,Every Road Leads Home To You,"I've got your picture on my phone,  
Your voice in my head,  
I'm lying here alone,  
Restless in a far away bed,  
The stars are falling down  
And I'm half the world away,  
I'm just trying to close the distance,  
To feel each breath that you take,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like a wild arrow flying  
And I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew  
And every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
  
So you got me to believe,  
Made me turn on a dime,  
The writing on the wall  
Right in front of me  
Every song, every rhyme,  
  
But I don't need a thousand words,  
I need you safe in my arms,  
I'll be standing strong,  
I'll keep holding on  
When life tries tearing us apart,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like a wild arrow flying  
Now I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew,  
  
No I ain't regretting  
Just how lost I'm getting  
Or the red lights I've been blowing through,  
My foot will find the pedal  
As I'm counting the lines,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
  
Home,  
The road still leads me home to you,  
Sometimes I don't see the signs,  
The headlights make me blind,  
The road still leads me home to you,  
  
[Solo]  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like the wild arrow flying  
Now I'm blindly running from  
Everything I thought I knew,  
  
No I ain't regretting  
Just how lost I'm getting  
Or the red lights I've been blowing through,  
My foot will find the pedal  
As I'm counting the lines,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
Home to you,  
Home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
Every road  
Leads home to you  
  
Every road leads home to you.

107,Bon Jovi,Every Word Was A Piece Of My Heart,"J. Bon jovi  
  
I've been staring at the page  
For what seems like days  
I guess I put this one off for a while  
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes  
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried  
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you  
Hey now, I guess the nights just bringing me down  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Youve been the blood in my veins  
The only one who knows my middle name  
And the smiles they came easy cause of you  
You know that I love you, but I hate you  
Cause I know I can never escape you  
Let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark  
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I haven't said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch  
Maybe I've lost my guts - there, is that truth enough  
Hey now, hey now  
  
You know these love letters mix with whisky  
Just don't light a match when you kiss me  
Though Ill blow away, you know Ill be back soon  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, am I talking just a little too loud  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I haven't said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud  
Hey now, the nights just bringing me down

Goodbye to all my yesterdays  
Goodbye, so long, I'm on my way

Strange, everybody's feeling strange  
Never gonna be the same  
Makes you wonder how the world keeps turning  
Life, learning how to live my life  
Learning how to pick my fights  
Take my shots while I'm still burning  
  
Goodbye to all those rainy nights  
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on

110,Bon Jovi,Father Time,"(sambora, child)  
  
Father time  
I couldn't make her wanna stay  
I couldn't seem to find the words to say  
Now I have to live in yesterday  
Father time  
  
I thought that you were on my side  
I thought that I could keep our love alive  
I thought that I could keep her satisfied  
  
The clock keeps tickin and I keep on thinkin bout you  
I'm knockin at the door of your heart but I can't break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Now shes gone  
She didn't even say goodbye  
I guess she didn't have the heart to try  
She didn't even have the guts to lie  
Father time  
Only you can turn the page  
And close the curtain on this empty stage  
Only you can take my pain away  
  
My heart keeps breakin and my body keeps aching for you  
Its time to hold on but theres nothin left to hold on to  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Father, father can't you see I'm depending on you  
I'm dying at the door to your heart and I can't break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
Shes your child make her mine  
Father time

111,Bon Jovi,Fear,"I see you looking over your shoulder  
Tell me who do you think's out there  
You're reaching for your four leaf clover  
But baby there ain't no luck down there  
I swear that there's no heart in this city  
It's here the slogan reads  
""Do your time"" everybody's doing  
their sentence  
It's just there ain't nobody here  
Who knows just what's the crime  
I watched my father live a lie here  
I'd rather die than fade away  
I read the rules  
And yeah I know them  
Still you ain't ever gonna  
Make me play the game of  
Fear  
Fear  
Fear  
Fear  
  
Running with the rats  
Through the city  
Makes you feel like you're  
A partner in crime  
Girl once you won't stop to watch  
That little girl did  
  
Hey baby won't you stop and hear me  
Just being here we're  
breathing heart attacks  
We can run and chase  
The setting sun we can run  
And we won't ever look back  
  
Take my hand I know we'll make it  
I'll let nothing slow us down  
I know you want to curse  
This place but there's only  
One thing that's stopping us now  
  
Fear fear fear  
Of a new thing  
Fear fear fear  
Of the brass ring  
  
You ain't one for taking chances  
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5  
Still that's what you call living  
That's surviving to me  
  
And surviving is living to die in  
Fear

112,Bon Jovi,Feeling Like Making Love,"Baby When I think about you I think about love  
Darlin' Gonna live without you And your love  
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you In the Heavens  
And feel it dying dying dying all the way  
  
Feel like makin' Feel like makin' love

113,Bon Jovi,Fields Of Fire,"There's no-one watching over me tonight and I'm afraid to turn out the lights,  
If I close my eyes, it'll all go away and I don't wanna see it end this way.  
  
There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us  
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad  
  
Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard  
I'll keep my business, but I'm a little bit afraid  
Through the years one thing hasn't changed  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swin in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Now feeling good is not good enough, I know they've changed but not that much  
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, I never was one who needs to give
enough  
I ain't a hero who gets the girl, but if I had my chance to save the world  
I won't blow it now, I guess I'll understand  
This boy becoming a man  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Well, look at your hands if you hear what I said.  
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends  
I know that I'm lucky, I know I'm right.  
Fingerst turn into fists, we're here to take on the night.  
That's right  
  
Now I'm staring at an open door, we've had a lot and I want much more  
You can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold  
If someone gives me back my soul  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would run through fields of fire  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I would run  
All the way back home, I would run,  
Baby come along

115,Bon Jovi,Get Ready,"You need someone to make it last  
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast  
They fade away  
Tonight you're not gonna be alone  
Making love on the telephone  
Baby, baby if you can hold on  
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight  
I like 'em down and dirty, hold on tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on get ready  
Come on get ready  
  
You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes  
You got the style and you got the moves  
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose  
You're caught up in a danger zone  
Just seventeen but you act full grown  
The nightlife is turning you on  
You want to take me all the way tonight  
Take my hand, you can feel the heat  
Make you feel alright

Come on  
Come on

116,Bon Jovi,Good Guys Don't Always Wear White,"You say you don't like my kind  
A bitter picture in your mind  
No, it don't matter what I say  
I hear you bitchin' when I walk away  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
You tell me I'm wrong but I disagree  
I ain't go no apology  
Just because I don't look like you, talk like you, think like you  
Judge and jury, a hangman's noose  
I see them in your eyes  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
You judge a man who don't stand in line  
Just because he ain't on your side  
You know the man who wears those shoes  
If you cut me don't I bleed like you? (You know I do)  
  
I don't know what you've been told  
Can't buy guts with a pot o' gold  
A rich man's poor if he got no soul  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, king  
All that shit don't mean a thing  
Do you know which one's behind those eyes?  
It's all a disguise  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Hey baby, whose side you on?  
You think you got it all figured out where we belong  
Forget all about your dark from light  
Day from night  
Wrong from right  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Tell your Mama, baby

Don't always wear, don't always wear  
Don't always wear, don't always wear

117,Bon Jovi,Gotta Have A Reason,"Here we stand, caught between the cradle and the grave  
In a world that gives you nothing but your name  
With every step you take, you must be brave  
Nothing lost is nothing gained  
  
And I know lives are lost for crowns and kings  
We all know love is lost for lesser things  
And the angels here have broken wings  
Though I know somewhere a choir sings  
  
You gotta have a reason  
A reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe  
  
A hot-headed hero, here you see I'm just a man  
Comes a time, a time to make a stand, yeah  
So here I am with heart in hand  
Don't be afraid to understand  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe in trust  
  
I believe in faith  
I believe in us  
'Til my dying day  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa, you gotta have a reason, yeah  
  
If all we've got is you and me  
Then what we've got is all we need  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa, you gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream, yeah

118,Bon Jovi,Hallelujah,"Well, I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played to please the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
  
Well, it goes like this the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
  
And she tied you to her kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from the lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Yeah, baby, I've been here before  
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor  
I used to live alone before I knew you  
  
And I've seen your flag on that marble arch  
Your love is not a victory march  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, there was a time when you let me know  
What was going on below  
Now you don't never show that to me, do you?  
  
But remember when I moved in you  
And the holy dove was moving too  
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, now maybe there's a God above  
But all I've ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
  
And it's not your cry that I hear at night, no  
It's not someone who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah

119,Bon Jovi,Hard Times Comes Easy,"Are. Sambora  
  
Its amazing  
We go through changes  
When times get crazy  
Its up and down, its hot and cold  
These complications  
Just keep on coming  
These aint no running  
When it comes to life that's how it goes  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
It could eat up  
If you try and keep it all inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
Theres gonna be thunder  
Theres gonna be rain  
Theres gonna be those times  
We both get caught up in the pain  
The realization  
Keeps sinkin in  
The way you make it  
Is learn to take it on the chin  
Round and round we go  
Its just another day  
With trouble knockin at your door  
Baby don't you know  
We can work it out  
Cause we always seem to find a cure  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
Well keep holdin on  
Through the changes that we feel inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Hard times come easy babe

The old man down on the corner  
Is downing in his pain  
I can see the sorrow in his eyes  
His tears, the leave a stain  
The streets have left him broken  
Hes in the final phase  
Its been a long hard road  
From his glory days.  
Theres a tatoo of his sweetheart  
Fading on his arm  
He talks of painful tragedy  
How he lost his lucky charm  
His memory is clouded  
From the thunder in this vein  
Hes vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain.  
On desperation avenue  
The devil takes his toll  
Where the pushers and the poverty  
Slowly claim your soul  
When you reached the realization  
That you just can't break the chain, no  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain (harlem rain).  
In your seach for tender mercy  
No one seemed to care  
The faith that used to be your crutch  
Is now your cross to bear  
You last yourself so long ago  
You don't know who to blame  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.

Remember crying on a rainy day

Did I throw away the best part of my life  
When I cut you off, did I cut myself with the same damn knife  
Hide my tears in the pouring rain, had my share of hurt and pain  
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try

Since I've had your love here in my hands  
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it  
But, nothing's fair in love and hate  
You lay it all down and walk away , before it's too late  
We danced all night as the music played  
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made  
There in the stains , we remain,  
No one left to blame  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try

But I'll see the light again

126,Bon Jovi,I Just Wanna Be Your Man,"Hello, baby, it's only me  
I know you're tired, it's been a long hard week  
I was thinking maybe if you ain't got no plans  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
Know what you're thinking, that you've got your doubts  
I'm the only one that knows what your dreams are about  
If you say no then I will understand  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
And all I want is to dream out loud  
We used to think we had it all worked out  
I know that you don't want to be alone  
The streets outside are so damn cold  
You still ever think of you and me as 'us'?  
Or another thing we let die and turn to dust?  
I wasn't there to clean the cuts  
I want the one who got caught in the ruts  
I was just thinking maybe if you got no plans  
I...  
I just wanna...  
Tonight I wanna be your man

You don't have to look too far, to find a friendly face  
I feel alive when I'm walkin' on this street  
I feel the heart of the city poundin' underneath my feet  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah let the world keep spinnin' round 'n' round  
This is where it all goes down, down, down  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I keep comin' 'round  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
I've got some good friends here, I might have broke a heart or two  
It's gettin' loud over there, boys must have had a few  
And hey the cop on the corner, he knows everybody's name  
And a kid with a train singin' for some spare loose change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
There's shoutin' from the rooftops  
Dancin' on the bars  
Hangin' out the window  
Drivin' in their famous cars  
You want it? You got it  
You ready? I'm on it  
Come on now, here we go again...  
  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I love this town  
  
No matter where you're from, tonight you're from right here  
This is where it all goes down, down, down

128,Bon Jovi,I Talk To Jesus (Demo),"I talk to jesus  
  
It's like trying to light a match in the rain  
Trying to find a way to explain  
I came to meet the face that graced me cable tv  
I'm his biggest fan, 'like this, him and me  
  
Has he gone out, is he in a meeting  
I know that you can't tell me for security reasons  
  
But, Mister, tell me are you one of the Saints  
Hey, maybe I could take a number and wait  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
And I talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
See, I've got a picture of us here in my wallet  
I'd really like to show you...  
Oh, I guess I forgot it  
But, I've got this bracelet, I've got this I'd  
That the people down at county gave me  
  
I know you think I'm special, hear it all the time  
You don't have to V. I. P. Me, I'm a regular guy  
I'd really like to sit and talk sometimes  
But, I'm taping Sally Jesse at five  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
Have you seen the papers today  
If I could, I'd get down and pray  
Tell me if the shepherds on the way  
  
You know Elvis Presley talks to me  
Through my school teacher  
Jon Lennon moved in down the street  
He bought the pizzeria  
  
And aliens control our lives  
And when we speak, they're in our minds  
And Heather Locklear is my wife  
And, Man ain't a lucky guy  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus

But you didn't, but you did  
And I thank you  
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
If you took your love to someone else  
I know what I meant to be the loving dare  
You made me feel like I've never felt  
Your kiss is so good, I got the holler for help  
  
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to hold me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
Now every day there's something new  
You put your make-up and your mild perfume  
You got me trying to do things, too  
Just so that I can keep up with you  
  
You didn't have to shake me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to make me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
All my life I've been short changed  
Without your love it would be a crying shame  
Now I know what love I'm looking for  
When they say they're being turned on  
  
I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you  
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say

130,Bon Jovi,I Want To Be Loved,"I had a roof overhead  
Had shoes on my feet  
Yeah, sure I was fed  
But no one was there when I was in need, yeah  
  
So who am I now?  
Who do you want me to be?  
I can forgive you but I won't re-live you  
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be

I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to be loved  
I want to be loved  
  
I found a picture  
Our so-called family tree, yeah  
I broke all the branches lookin' for answers  
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
I'm ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to be loved  
I want to be  
  
I ain't gonna cry, I don't want to scream  
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
Don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give

131,Bon Jovi,I Want You,"The last time I saw her  
Was the night she said goodbye  
She said that loves a stranger  
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did  
As she packed up her belongings  
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye  
But I could see a tear roll  
Off her face  
As we both tried so hard  
Not to cry she said  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I tried so hard to remember  
Where when how why love went away  
I tried to drown myself in pity  
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did  
  
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings, baby  
All the things that money brings  
And the servants to paint the sky blue  
And I worked so hard seven days a week  
And built a fortress for your heart to keep  
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I want you, I want you, baby I want you  
  
But never thought you were alone  
I filled the party up with company  
But never made our house a home  
  
All I've got is my guitar these chords and the truth  
All I've got is my guitar, but all, baby all I want  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I want you, I want you, baby I want you [Repeat: x4]

132,Bon Jovi,I'd Die For You,"If you could see inside my heart  
Then you 'd understand  
I'd never mean to hurt you  
Baby I'm not that kind of man  
  
I might not say I'm sorry  
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes  
And I might forget the little things  
Or keep you hanging on the line  
  
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
I'd do anything  
I'd lie for you  
You know it's true  
Baby I'd die for you  
I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
If it came right down to me and you  
You know it's true, Baby I'd die for you  
  
I might not be a savior  
And I'll never be a king  
I might not send you roses  
Or buy you diamond rings  
  
But if I could see inside you  
Maybe I'd know just who we are  
Cause our love is like a hunger  
Without it we would starve  
  
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry

Forever winding where it leads us  
I don't know  
In it together  
For better or worse  
Searching for our pal of gold.  
Time  
Leaves a trail of broken hearts  
So many arrows just keep missing  
Their mark  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love, baby  
Yeah  
Well share in the laughter  
Share in the tears  
And the promises we keep  
Life can be crazy  
Love can be cruel  
But its always been a two way street  
You try  
And give it all you have to give  
So many people don't know how to forgive  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow

139,Bon Jovi,"Janie, Don't Take Your Love To Town","J. Bon jovi  
  
Sitting here just watching you sleep  
Wish I could slip inside and be  
In some technicolor dream  
But the airs too thick for one of us to breathe  
I'm not fool enough to think  
You couldn't live life without me  
  
I didn't come this far to throw the towel in  
I didn't fight this hard to walk away  
If I aint smart enough to say I'm sorry  
Its just because the words got in the way  
  
I remember how it used to be  
I was you and you were me  
We were more than just the same  
Now these shoes don't fit, my skins too tight  
When you want a kiss, I take a bite  
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights  
  
Last night I drak enough to drown  
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health  
Look, we both know how much I've let you down  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
You deserve a shooter, a saint  
Someone to give it to you straight  
To find the soul throught flesh and bone  
My lifes a treasure, full of sunny weather  
But its left me feeling cold  
Now all you want to do is take me home  
  
I hated you, the night you said you loved me  
I hated you, cause I couldn't love myself  
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me  
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Sitting here while youre fast asleep  
In the bathroom by the sink  
Trying to write the right words down  
I turn out the lights, close my eyes  
There aint no prayers or kiss goodnight  
What Ill forget to say tomorrow, Ill say now  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town

140,Bon Jovi,Jersey Girl,"I got no time for the corner boys  
Down in the street making all that noise  
Or the girls out on the avenue  
'Cause tonight I wanna be with you  
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride  
Across the river to the Jersey side  
Take my baby to the carnival  
And I'll take her on all the rides  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
You know all my dreams come true  
When I'm walking down the street with you  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms  
My little girl gives me everything  
I know that some day she'll wear my ring  
So don't bother me man I ain't got no time  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine  
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
I see you on the street and you look so tired  
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired  
When I come by to take you out to eat  
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep  
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on  
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's  
I know a place where the dancing's free  
Now baby won't you come with me  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
Nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

141,Bon Jovi,Judgement Day,"You take and you take without giving  
Like the ride is never going to end  
You think you know who's going to Heaven  
Well I know I'm going to see you again  
On Judgement Day  
Others, they walk the bad road  
If you do you better watch what you say  
You think that you can hide in your shadow  
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire, no where to run to, no one to blame  
Cause Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
Some people they call me brother  
Some people they say that they care  
Some people they steal from the Heavens above  
It's going to be a cross to bear  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
With nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Well Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
It's just you and me  
I won't fade away  
Let's face up to the truth  
It's our own Judgement Day  
  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
Nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day

142,Bon Jovi,Keep The Faith,"Mother mother tell your children  
That their time has just begun  
I have suffered for my anger  
There are wars that can't be won

Forgive me  
Forgive your wayward son  
  
Everybody needs somebody to love

Right now we got to  
Keep the faith  
Keep the faith

Do you keep it all inside  
Do you tell me al's forgiven  
And just hide behind your pride

Lord we got to keep the faith  
  
Walking in the footsteps  
Of society's lies  
I don't like what I see no more  
Sometimes I wish that I was blind  
Sometimes I wait forever  
  
To stand out in the rain  
So no one sees me cryin'  
Trying to wash away the pain  
Mother father  
  
There's things I've done I can't erase  
Every night we fall from grace  
  
It's hard with the world in yours face  
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on  
  
Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain  
Lord you got to keep the faith  
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate  
Right now we got to keep the faith  
Faith: now it's not too late  
Try to hold on, trying to hold on  
Keep the faith

144,Bon Jovi,Last Man Standing,"Come see a living, breathing spectacle  
Only seen right here  
It's your last chance in this lifetime  
The line forms to the rear  
You won't believe your eyes  
Your eyes will not believe you're ears  
Get your money out, get ready  
Step right up, yeah you, come here  
  
You ain't seen nothing like him  
the last one of the breed  
You better hold on to your honey  
Honeys, don't forget to breathe

No this boy he don't lip-synch

Here's the last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come and see, hear, feel, the real thing  
  
See those real live calloused fingers  
Wrapped around those guitar strings  
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered  
It breaks the hart to hear him sing  
The songs were more than music  
They were pictures from the soul  
Se keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk  
And your digital downloads  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take your seats now, folks. It's showtime  
Hey, Patrick - hit the lights  
There's something in the air  
There's magic in the night  
Now here's the band, they really play  
I'll count the first one in  
I don't know where it's gone  
Well all know where it's been

The last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come see, hear, feel, the real thing.

146,Bon Jovi,Let It Rock,"The weekend comes to this town  
Seven days too soon  
For the ones who have to make up  
What we break up of their rules  
  
Well I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset  
Tell his boys they're in command  
While Chino danced a tango  
With a broomstick in his hand  
He said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time  
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line  
To break on through to the other side  
  
Let it rock, let it go  
You can't stop a fire burning out of control  
Let it rock, let it go  
With the night you're on the loose  
You got to let it rock  
  
We go down to the Broadway  
Where everybody goes  
To get on their rockin' horse  
And blast that radio  
Well I saw Roxie on the table  
Her girlfriend down below  
They'll give it to the king of swing  
Before it's time to go  
  
They said, It's alright (alright) if you have a good time  
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line  
To break on through to the other side  
  
Let it rock, let it go  
You can't stop a fire burning out of control  
Let it rock, let it go  
With the night you're on the loose  
You got to let it rock

147,Bon Jovi,Let's Make It Baby,"When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire.  
A see through disguise cant conceal desire  
I've been readin' your lips, they don't need no translation  
They want more than a kiss, I come to make my donation  
  
So turn out the lights, I'm going down slowly.  
Don't tell me what's right. Just tell me you want me.  
Tell me you want me.  
Just tell me you want me, want me, want me

Get the sheets all wet, I wanna make you feel naughty

148,Bon Jovi,Letting You Go,"It ain't no fun lying down to sleep  
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep  
I wish the stars up in the sky  
Would all just call in sick  
And the clouds would take the moon out  
On some one-way trip  
  
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend  
But somehow they drove me back here once again  
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul  
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home  
It would all have been so easy  
If you'd only made me cry  
And told me how you're leaving me  
To some organ grinder's lullaby  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue  
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to  
Well - me, these days  
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane  
Unless you're coming back for me  
That's one thing I know that won't change  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart  
And we'll find you somebody else new  
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips  
When I bet all that I had on you  
  
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard  
It's hard letting you go  
It's hard, so hard, it's tearing out my heart  
But it's hard letting you go

"
149,Bon Jovi,Love Ain't Nothing But A Four Letter Word,"She was waiting alone at the station  
Praying for her train to arrive  
Thinking 'bout her destination  
The tattered bag had all she had in life  
  
She turned her back on her family  
She turned her back on her friends  
She turned her back on a married man  
When she took off that wedding band  
  
She said, ""I'm giving up, silver clouds have turned to gray  
Had enough, there's got to be a better way""  
Giving up, you know you've gotta walk  
There's some things in life still worth fighting for  
  
Ain't no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
This time he said was the last time  
Last time he said just the same  
In your heart you know that they'll be a next time  
That your battered bones would have to explain  
  
Giving up, nothing's changing but the score  
Had enough, every night love turns to war  
Give it up, gave it all and wanted more  
It ain't nothing worth dying for  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
Forget your mama's Rosary beads  
To get you through this time of need  
You know you gotta cross that line  
You take it one day at a time  
  
Had enough, the silver clouds all turning gray  
I'm heading for a better day  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing, it ain't nothing now, baby  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing, nothing now, baby  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing

150,Bon Jovi,Love For Sale,"Well, I wake up this morning, I rolled out of bed  
I felt like a dog who's been kicked in the head  
Checked out my mail, there was letter that read  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
I picked up the phone, I called everyone I could  
I let my fingers do the walking through the telephone book  
You can't catch a fish if you ain't got the hook  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
Send up a signal, throw me a line  
Somebody explain ""this funny Valentine""  
It might not be legal but it sure ain't a crime  
I'm one step from crazy and two steps behind  
  
I called Lieutenant Columbo from my TV set  
I've tried the Dating Game, I haven't found her yet  
I'm hoping that she's looking like a Penthouse Pet  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
We've been living together three years  
Two hours, twenty minutes, maybe four hundred beers  
You can't shop for love when you're shopping at Sears  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
I guess I've learned my lesson, it was easy to see  
My old lady, she played this joke on me  
I never looked where I forgot it would be  
Love for sale, love for sale

151,Bon Jovi,Love Hurts,"Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and harms  
Any heart not tough or strong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
'Cause I'm young, I know but even so  
I know a thing or two, that I've learned from you  
Really learned a lot, really taught me a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns yourself when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves, I guess  
They ain't foolin' me I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true  
Love is like a flame, makes your heart so blue  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee yes, love hurts

152,Bon Jovi,Love Is War,"Load your guns, take sides  
Raise your flag, cause baby, love is war  
  
Hey baby, what ever happened to the girl next door  
If I remember, she looked a lot like you  
Whatever happened to the boy who said, Id die for you  
Were hangin on, but love is gone and now its war  
  
You got your weapons, baby I got mine  
You tried to trap me with your bedroom eyes  
Under the covers, cross the enemy lines  
When you dont know, you just say no.  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is tryin to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
Where boy meets girl, love is war  
  
Oh I remember when the love was good and the bed was hot  
But now we sleep on separate sides and the sheets are cold  
Aw, I used to love your candy baby, now the store is closed  
  
I know my silence tears you up inside  
You built a fortress for your hurt to hide  
You think youve won, but its a tie  
cause nobody wins a war of pride  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is tryin to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
Where boy meets girl, love is war  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
What the hell are we fighting for  
  
Tell me why love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is trying to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
  
Tell me why love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is trying to even up the score

153,Bon Jovi,Love Lies,"I was lost, then I found you.  
I never thought it would be this way.  
Showed you my heart, I left it unguarded,  
Like a thief in the night you stole it away.  
  
Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on.  
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night.  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
You're just a number of the love lies.  
  
All alone you call it survival,  
He lost at love to a stranger's lines.  
Walking the streets, searching with vengence  
For a face that he dreams of night after night.  
  
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken.  
Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive?  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
They met late one night in the city.  
Both men knew only one would stay.  
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet  
And took his life away.  
  
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.

"
154,Bon Jovi,Love's The Only Rule,"I don't give a damn how it's supposed to be  
That might work for you, it don't work for me  
You write your truth and I'll write mine  
One man's ceiling's another man's sky high  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Crying like the lonely whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
Spit in the eye of a hurricane  
Who said life has got to be so cruel  
Love's the only rule  
  
It's written in the stars where I fit in  
It's going to hurt sometimes, you got to lose to win  
You got your sins and I got mine  
Sell your secrets, kiss them all goodbye  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like it's a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
Think about it, wouldn't that be cool?  
Love's the only rule  
  
Might be a wrecking ball  
Or just a wake up call  
Don't matter where the pieces fall  
  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
  
I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane  
Cry like the whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
I'm alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like its a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
  
Where love, love's the only rule  
Yes love, love's the only rule

155,Bon Jovi,Made In America,"Are. Sambora  
  
Made in america  
Nineten fifteen nine  
Born down by the factories  
Cross the jersey city line  
Raised on radio  
Just a jukebox kid  
I was alright  
Just a small town homeboy  
With big time dreams  
Foollowing his conscience  
In a world full of extremes  
Fresh outta high school  
Only seventeen  
I was alright  
Blinded by my vision  
There ws just no turning back  
Lika a runaway train  
Life was steaming down the track  
Youd say Id never make it out  
But I kept on hanging on  
Every night I prayed to jesus  
And held my head up strong  
I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
My old mans independence  
Seemed good enough for me  
I was made in america  
Made in america  
Never cared much about politics  
Til I was twenty one  
But I woke up when lennon  
Found the wrong end of a gun  
He left his inspiration  
Before he said boodbye  
And we were alright  
We all lose out innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold  
When I kissed those younger days goodbye  
It almost broke my heart  
I was going to ghrough my growing pains  
I was driving in the dark  
But I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
I'm facing up to freedom  
And chacing down my dream  
I was made in america  
Yeah I was made in america  
Yeah we all lose our innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I just didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold  
When they said Id never make it  
I just kept on hanging on  
And every night I prayed to jesus  
And I held my head up strong  
And I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
Facing up to who I am  
Chasing down my dream  
I was made in america  
Yeah I was made in america

156,Bon Jovi,Make A Memory,"Hello again, it's you and me  
Kinda always like it used to be  
Sippin' wine, killin' time  
Tryin' to solve life's mysteries  
  
How's your life? It's been a while  
God, it's good to see you smile  
I see you reaching for your keys  
Looking for a reason, not to leave  
  
If you don't know if you should stay  
If you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
I dug up this old photograph  
Look at all that hair we had  
It's bittersweet to hear you laugh  
Your phone is ringing, I don't wanna ask  
  
If you go now, I'll understand  
If you stay, hey, I've got a plan  
We're gonna make a memory  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
If you don't know if you should stay  
And you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be, we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
You wanna make a memory

157,Bon Jovi,Maybe Someday,"And I would give up tomorrow  
And die for one yesterday  
I'd lie, beg, steal and borrow  
To hear you whisper my name  
  
Tonight there ain't no miracles  
Washing up on this beach  
The angels left here long ago  
But I still believe  
  
That maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
Maybe someday  
  
Now I don't know how a heart beats  
But I sure know how one breaks  
Remember how I used to hold you  
To share every breath that you'd take  
  
How can I forget  
You're every tear that I cry?  
I know you're coming back  
You never kissed me goodbye  
  
Maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
  
They say that nothing lasts forever  
But we know our two hearts beat together  
And though you're far away, every night I pray  
Maybe someday, someday  
  
Maybe someday  
I will understand  
Maybe someway  
We'll trace these footsteps in the sand  
Just walk away  
  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someway

158,Bon Jovi,Memphis Lives In Me,"There's a town that I call home  
Where all the streets are paved with soul  
Down on Beale there's a honky-tonk bar  
So hear the wail of a blues guitar  
Have a beer and drop a dime in the blind man's jar  
The blues sing softly in the air like a Sunday morning prayer  
Just one more drink and you'll see God everywhere  
Like a sad old melody that cheers you up, it sets you free  
That's how Memphis lives in me  
There comes a time when muddy waters run rough  
There comes a point when a man has had enough  
Like a friend that always stands by me  
Memphis knows me  
Never showed me  
How did life just had to be  
I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye  
Here I was born and here is where I'll die  
I'm just a man from Tennessee  
I can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives in me  
I said I'm just a man from Tennessee  
Can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives  
All I know is Memphis gives

159,Bon Jovi,Midnight In Chelsea,"J. bon jovi, dave stewart  
  
The kids round here look just like sticks  
They trade old licks with a beat up six  
I just smile and catch the groove  
  
Gothic girls all dress in black  
Serious as heart attacks  
It takes a little bit of getting used to  
  
The old man with the whiskey stains  
Lost the night forgot his name  
His poor wife will sleep alone again  
And it aint hard to understand  
Why shes holding on to her own hand  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Ive seen a lone,sloane ranger drive  
Seems her chauffeur took a dive  
And sold her secrets to the sun  
And later in a magazine  
I finally figured what it means  
To be a saint, not a queen  
  
Two lustful lovers catch a spark  
And chase their shadows in the dark  
Someones getting off tonight  
Of a big red bus thats packed so tight  
It disappears in a trail of light  
Somewhere someones dreaming baby its all right...  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
Midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
When chelsea girls sing...  
  
Its morning when I go to sleep  
In the distant dawn a church bell rings  
Another day is coming on  
A babys born, an old man dies  
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye  
I leave my soul and just move on  
And wish that I was there to sing this song  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
The man I want to be,the man I want to be  
Midnight in chelsea

160,Bon Jovi,Miracle,"A penny for your thoughts now baby  
Looks like the weight of the world's  
On your shoulders now  
  
I know you think you're going crazy  
Just when it seems everything's  
Gonna work itself out  
They drive you right back down  
  
And you said it ain't fair  
That a man walks  
When a bird can fly  
We have to kick the ground  
The stars kiss the sky  
They say that spirits live  
A man has to die  
They promised us truth  
Now they're giving us lies  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause it's all on the line  
And I won't let you down  
(No I won't let you down)  
The river of your hope is flooding  
And I know the dam is busted  
If you need me I'll come running  
I won't let you down, no, no  
  
You're looking for salvation  
You thought that it'd be shining  
Like an angel's light  
Well, the angels left this nation  
And salvation caught the last train  
Out tonight  
He lost one hell of a fight  
  
He said  
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be  
I never can be everything you wanted from me  
I've got plans so big  
That any blind man could see  
I'm standing in the river  
Now I'm drowning in the sea  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's on the line  
And your heartbeat is slowing down  
Your feet are grounded still  
You're reaching for the sky  
You can let 'em clip your wings  
'Cause I believe that you can fly  
  
Well my eyes have seen the horror  
Of the coming of the flood  
I've driven deep the thorny crown  
Into the soul of someone's son  
Still I'll look you in the eye  
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought  
And I'll die without regret  
For the wars I have fought  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save you this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's doing time  
And your conscience is calling you out  
It ain't all for nothing  
Life ain't written in the sand  
I know the tide is coming  
But it's time we made a stand  
With a miracle

161,Bon Jovi,Miss Fourth Of July,"I used to live but now I survive  
I used to believe but now it's just one day at a time  
The circus is gone, it's all packed away  
The clown's hat, the makeup's been packed in his case  
So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn  
I used to laugh but I've learned to cry  
And I ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes  
For all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears  
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here  
I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing  
But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth  
When innocence sang his last song  
He'd tell me that it's all gone  
Just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at all  
I used to live, I've learned to die  
And I used to dream, I used to dream  
So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we've never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for, they've left us with nothing but dawn  
Oh yeah  
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak  
A handful of blues  
Oh yeah  
I'll never get off these

Don't have to take it when you're big time

In the big reclining chair  
With a cold six pack of beer  
You've got a front row seat  
Lean back and put up you're feet  
Man, the future is looking bright from here  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
I can taste it, I'll be prime time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too

Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Ain't going to waste it when I'm big time

Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too

163,Bon Jovi,More Than We Bargained For,"I've always wanted what I couldn't have  
I hope and dream that maybe someday  
That I'd find out what love was all about  
I sure grew up tonight the hard way  
Now the candy store's closed, the movie's sold out  
High Plains Drifter isn't what it's all about  
And now were parting ways, I won't say a word  
Let our broken hearts cry in their graves  
Where they'll never be heard  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
Last night I saw you out with my best friend  
When I'm with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I don't understand  
There's something there that's so hard to disguise  
  
Now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night  
Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
It's more than we bargained for  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away

166,Bon Jovi,My Guitar Lies Bleeding In My Arms,"Misery likes company I like the way that sounds  
I've been trying to find the meaning  
So I can write it down  
Staring out the window it's such a long way down  
I'd like to jump but I'm afraid to hit the ground  
  
I can't write a love song the way I fell today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Since you went away  
I sing this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
I'm tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream  
Outside the world is burning  
Man it's so hard to believe  
Each day you know you're dying  
From the cradle to the grave  
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Strange enough these days  
I send this song to you whoever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Staring at the paper I don't know what to write  
I'll have my cigarette-well, turn out the lights  
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way  
But here in my delusion I don't know what to say  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
And I can't fight the feelings  
That are burning in my veins  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
There's no one left to save  
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

167,Bon Jovi,Mystery Train,"There are days when she's a whisper  
Nights when she's a scream  
A reason to wake up in the morning  
To close your eyes and dream

She'll wound you with her eyes  
She always makes it better  
But she won't apologize  
I know everything about her but don't know her at all

She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place you've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
You're not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
Mystery train  
  
She cries because she's happy  
She sings songs when she's mad  
Like a stiff drink when you need it  
She's good at being bad  
And long before you knew her you knew she was the one

She liked her drink  
Sucked the head off her lagger  
Threw me a wink  
And she said to me buddy, whats your sign?  
  
I was off I was runnin  
Knocked me clean off my feet  
Her tongue kept on selling  
What any blind man could see  
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs  
  
She said what you hiding underneath that shirt?  
Right behing the buttons theres a heart that hurts  
Adams evening left the curse  
Take it off make it work  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it  
All I'm saying  
  
The tail you been chasing  
Put the k back in kink  
Threw a coin in her jukebox  
I started to think  
She just smiled and offered me a peace sign  
  
How far you gonna run in those designer shoes  
The soul with holes aint gonna be the one you lose  
I don't know which one is worse  
Adam, me or you  
  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it

Take it, embrace it

170,Bon Jovi,Never Say Die,"As we stood there older than men  
And younger than the boys (that's right)  
We were as still as the wind  
That blows on a hot August night  
  
And you were lonesome  
As a jukebox  
But deadly just the same  
I could be as gentle as a newborn  
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane  
  
And we knew how to laugh  
And we knew how to cry  
Yeah, we sure knew how to live  
But we don't ever  
  
Never say die  
Never say die  
  
I guess you'd say we had a pact  
These words we knew so well (that's right)  
Still they remained unspoken  
And we'd take them to the fiery  
Gates of hell  
  
Once I was afraid of love  
But when it's your brother  
Those things change  
'Cause love is just another word  
For trust  
So hear me when I say  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die  
  
Yeah, and we could run like lightning  
Through the pouring rain  
And we'll be standing like a soldier  
Who comes marching home again  
  
They ask what it is that I want written  
On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry  
  
My spirit is still riding somewhere  
Somewhere in this night  
When it's these three words that come to me  
As I kiss this world goodbye  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die

The night about to end  
I pass my time with strangers  
But this bottle's my only friend  
  
Remember when we used to park  
On Butler Street out in the dark  
Remember when we lost the keys  
And you lost more than that in my backseat  
  
Remember how we used to talk  
About busting out, we'd break their hearts  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
You and me and my old friends  
Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye  
  
Remember days of skipping school  
Racing cars and being cool  
With a six pack and the radio  
We didn't need no place to go  
  
Remember at the prom that night  
You and me we had a fight  
But the band they played our favorite song  
And I held you in my arms so strong  
  
We danced so close  
We danced so slow  
And I swore I'd never let you go  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
You and me and my old friends  
Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

About busting out

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

"
172,Bon Jovi,Next 100 Years,"Time ain't nothing but time  
It's a verse with no rhyme  
Man, it all comes down to you  
  
Change ain't nothing but change  
Just the faces and the names  
But you know we're gonna make it through  
  
I'll believe  
When you don't believe in anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone  
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on  
I'll be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
If it all should end tonight  
I'll know it was worth the fight  
And we'll be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
  
I, when I think that I'm losing my mind  
It all comes back to you  
  
And you, you know that it's true  
After all we've been through  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
  
Stand by me  
And I would gladly give up everything  
  
[Chorus: x2]

"
173,Bon Jovi,No Apologies,"No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt  
  
Let's start this from the happy ending  
Just another white trash train-track kid  
Fighting for survival  
Trying not to do like his daddy did  
Double down the devil at three card monte  
No apology, he just knew when to quit  
Push your luck, say your prayers  
Make believe you don't care  
Take a chance, sometimes it's all you need  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
Think of living somebody else's life  
You can lie about retribution  
But there ain't no fire in your lover's eyes  
  
Seems like everybody's selling you dreams 'round here  
But no one's buying and it's closing time  
Light the fuse, make your break, there's no time left to waste  
Baby just like freedom, nothin's free  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
What else you gotta do tonight  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
(No apology)  
No apology  
(No apology)  
No apology  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies

174,Bon Jovi,No One Does It Like You,"When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everythig,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
Someone's taken my place,  
Baby say it ain't true  
All your friends say you love him,  
Baby say it ain't true  
I close my eyes and I see your face  
Those memories lost that I can't replace  
Of all the crazy things that we do  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
I was wrong I must have been crazy  
Now I think I'm goin' out of my mind  
These thoughts of you are driving me crazy  
A girl like you is so hard to find  
  
When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everything,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
I try to find a girl to treat me right  
I take a different one home every night  
But no one makes my dreams come true  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you

"
175,Bon Jovi,Nobody's Hero,"When you're afraid and it feels like you're too tired to fight  
Even if your heart don't know if you're still alive  
Man you never felt so alone in this world tonight  
And I, don't you know that I felt the same?  
I've seen the storm I've been through the rain  
You gotta know That I feel your pain  
Don't be afraid  
When you're on the edge, I will rescue you  
When you need a friend, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I'd lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby dream on me  
You can bleed on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
But out on these streets  
They're waiting for blind eyes to see  
They're waiting for our cuts to bleed  
I hear they're waiting for you and me  
Well alright, alright  
Cause this time  
You know I ain't afraid to fight  
For you I ain't afraid to die  
As long as you are by my side  
It will be alright  
When all faith is gone, I will pray for you  
Just keep holding on, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, you can bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
Baby, lean on me, you can dream on me  
Just bleed on me, just believe in me

"
176,Bon Jovi,Not Running Anymore,"Bless me father I have sinned  
I'm not sure where to begin  
I won't name names or where I've been  
But I've been there and back again  
No Hail Marys will save me  
You learned to live with memories  
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve  
Just stay inside until I leave  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never have both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running any more  
  
The hands of time they tick no more  
Let darkness fall upon this door  
No waves to wash up on this shore  
I won the fight but lost the war  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
And I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore  
  
There were those who I have loved  
Who've given all and given up  
I pushed your patience and my luck  
It wasn't love I didn't trust  
It wasn't you, or me, or us  
You've shouldered ifs, and ands, and buts  
It's not that way okay, I've said too much  
But I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore

"
177,Bon Jovi,Nothing,"We've been through this all before a thousand times  
Come on, come on, come on, tell me what's on your mind  
Doesn't matter, baby, what I say  
It all amounts to nothing anyway  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
(All that's ever left is nothing)  
  
I thought I saw you reach out, thought I saw you try  
Waiting here for something, nothing is all I find  
Kneeling at your altar, standing on the shore  
I'm waiting out, now listen, I'm outside your door  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I could learn to live without you but I would die  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down

"
178,Bon Jovi,Now And Forever,"It's been a long time, baby, how've you been,  
But it sure feels good to see you again, my friend.  
I still remember just like yesterdays  
Though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away  
And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
I still remember when you didn't know my name.  
We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,  
God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways  
  
But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song  
I hope that you say nothing's changed  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Now dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever.

179,Bon Jovi,Old Habits Die Hard,"You look like shit so dear my brother  
I missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother  
Jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red  
At least you got freedom in an open out there  
Free cheers till the best of the rest we got left  
  
If you could dream anything, what would that be?  
If you could dream back, would you share it with me?  
We carry our choices, we hide our regrets  
We know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts  
But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet  
  
'Cause old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me  
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea  
I have your back for each day that's gone by  
And I'll still have it till the day that I die  
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die  
  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind  
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
Appearances change but don't change who we are  
And old habits die hard

"
180,Bon Jovi,One Light Burning,"(sambora, foster, morolda)  
  
All alone in the dark  
No walls no windows  
Trying hard to define  
Heaven from hell  
Standing out in the rain  
With just one shadow  
Nothing to see or believe  
Beyond myself  
See my life going by  
Each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
All alone with my fears  
No words are spoken  
A story yet to be told  
Locked in my mind  
Hope is somewhere ahead  
Shining brightly  
But the past is always following close behind  
See my life going by, each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
Leading the way, leading the way
