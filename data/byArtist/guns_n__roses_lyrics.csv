0,Guns N' Roses,14 Years,"I try and feel the sunshine  
You bring the rain  
You try and hold me down  
With your complaints  
You cry and moan and complain  
You whine an tear  
Up to my neck in sorrow  
The touch you bring  
You just don't step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the beggar...  
I've played the thief  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Your stupid girlfriends tell you  
That I'm to blame  
Well - they're all used-up has-beens  
Out of the game  
This time I'll have the last word  
You hear what I say  
I tried to see it your way  
It won't work today  
You don't just step inside to 14 years  
So hard to keep my own head...that's what I say  
You know...I've been the dealer...hangin' on your street  
I was the dog...they all tried to beat  
  
But it's been  
Fourteen years of silence  
It's been  
Fourteen years of pain  
It's been  
Fourteen years that are gone forever  
And I'll never have again  
  
Bullshit and contemplation  
Gossip's their trade  
If they knew half the real truth  
What would they say  
Well I'm past the point of concern  
It's time to play  
These last four years of madness  
Sure put me straight  
You don't get back fourteen years  
In just one day  
So hard to keep my own head  
Just go away  
You know...just like a hooker she said  
Nothin's for free  
Oh I tried to see it your way  
I tried to see it your way

1,Guns N' Roses,Black Leather,"Ooh  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, she's all geared up, walkin' down the street  
And I can feel the slime, drippin' down her sleeve  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
  
Well, it's late at night, and I'm all alone  
And I can hear her boots as she's near her home  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Scratch, scratch, she's clawing at the door  
Whoa, no, I can't take it anymore  
Crack, crack I'm feeling so sore  
I never should asked for black leather  
Black leather  
Ooh, black leather  
Ow black leather  
  
And you can try to hide, but you won't get far  
You can let her in, and you'll start it again  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do  
Well, you can't refuse and you just can't choose what she's gonna do

2,Guns N' Roses,Catcher In The Rye,"When all is said and done  
We're not the only ones  
Who look at life this way  
That's what the old folks say  
But every time I'd see them  
Makes me wish I had a gun  
  
If I thought that I was crazy  
Well I guess I'd have more fun  
Guess I'd have more fun  
  
Oh no, no, no, no, no  
  
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh  
Won't let ya get away from him  
It's just another day like today  
  
You decide  
'Cause I don't have to  
Then they'll find  
And I won't ask you  
At anytime  
Or long hereafter  
If the cold's outside  
As I'm imagining  
It to be  
Oh no  
  
The Catcher in the Rye again ooh  
Won't let ya get away from him  
It's just another day like today  
  
When all is said and done  
We're not the only ones

That's what the young folks say  
But every time I'd see them  
Makes me wish I had a gun  
If I thought that I was crazy  
Well I guess I'd have more fun  
It's what used to be's not there for me  
And ought to find someone that belongs insane like I do  
  
Oh no  
Not at all [Repeat]  
  
On an ordinary day  
Not in an ordinary way  
All at once the song I heard  
No longer wouldn't play for anybody  
Or anyone  
That needed comfort from somebody  
Needed comfort from someone who cared  
To be  
Not like you  
And unlike me  
And then then voices ran away  
From me  
So now you set the wheels in motion  
It haunts our memories  
You were the instrument  
You were the one  
How a body took a body  
And Gave that boy a gun  
You took our innocence  
Beyond our stares  
Sometimes the only thing  
You got at all  
When no one else is there

"
3,Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Look at your young men fighting  
Look at your women crying  
Look at your young men dying  
The way they've always done before  
  
Look at the hate we're breeding  
Look at the fear we're feeding  
Look at the lives we're leading  
The way we've always done before  
  
My hands are tied  
The billions shift from side to side  
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride  
For the love of God and our human rights  
And all these things are swept aside  
By bloody hands time can't deny  
And are washed away by your genocide  
And history hides the lies of our civil wars  
  
D'you wear a black armband  
When they shot the man  
Who said ""peace could last forever""  
And in my first memories  
They shot Kennedy  
I went numb when I learned to see  
So I never fell for Vietnam  
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all  
That you can't trust freedom  
When it's not in your hands  
When everybody's fightin'  
For their promised land  
And  
  
I don't need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
Ow, oh no, no, no, no, no  
  
Look at the shoes you're filling  
Look at the blood we're spilling  
Look at the world we're killing  
The way we've always done before  
Look in the doubt we've wallowed  
Look at the leaders we've followed  
Look at the lies we've swallowed  
And I don't want to hear no more  
  
My hands are tied  
For all I've seen has changed my mind  
But still the wars go on as the years go by  
With no love of God or human rights  
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside  
By bloody hands of the hypnotized  
Who carry the cross of homicide  
And history bears the scars of our civil wars  
  
I don't need your civil war  
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  
I don't need your civil war  
I don't need your civil war  
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers  
In a human grocery store  
Ain't that fresh  
I don't need your civil war  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no  
I don't need one more war  
  
I don't need one more war  
No, no, no, no uh-oh-uh, no uh-oh, uh no  
Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway?

4,Guns N' Roses,Dead Flowers,"(Axl Rose and Gilby Clarke)  
  
Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know  
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company  
I never thought I'd ever be alone  
  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Well when you're sitting back in your rose pink Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day  
Ah, I'll be in my basement room with a needle and a spoon  
And another whore to take my pain away  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the U.S. Mail  
Say it with dead flowers in my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
No, I won't forget to put roses on your grave

5,Guns N' Roses,Down On The Farm,"All I need is some inspiration  
Before I do somebody some harm  
I feel just like a vegetable  
Down here on the farm  
  
Nobody comes to see me  
Nobody here to turn me on  
I ain't even got a lover  
Down here on the farm  
  
They told me to get healthy  
They told me to get some sun  
But boredom eats me like ketchup  
Down here on the farm  
  
Drinking lemonade shanty  
Ain't no body gonna do me harm  
But I'm like a fish out of water  
Down here on the farm  
  
I write a thousand letters  
'Til my fingers all gone numb  
But I never see no postman  
Down here on the farm  
  
I call my baby on the telephone  
I say come down and have some fun  
But she knows what the score is  
Down here on the farm  
  
I can't fall in love with a wheat field  
I can't fall in love with a barn  
When everything smells like horse shit  
Down here on the farm  
  
Blue skies and swimming pools  
Add so much charm  
But I'd rather be back in Soho  
Than down here on the farm  
  
On the fucking farm!  
  
Are you born in a fucking barn or what?  
  
Baaaaaa!

"
6,Guns N' Roses,Estranged,"When you're talkin' to yourself  
And nobody's home  
You can fool yourself  
You came in this world alone  
(Alone)  
  
So nobody ever told you baby  
How it was gonna be  
So what'll happen to you baby  
Guess we'll have to wait and see  
One, two  
  
Old at heart but I'm only twenty eight  
And I'm much too young  
To let love break my heart  
Young at heart but it's getting much too late  
To find ourselves so far apart  
  
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately  
An what more could you ask from me  
How could you say that I never needed you  
When you took everything  
Said you took everything from me  
  
Young at heart an it gets so hard to wait  
When no one I know can seem to help me now  
Old at heart but I musn't hesitate  
If I'm to find my own way out  
  
Still talkin' to myself  
And nobody's home  
(Alone)  
  
So nobody ever told us baby  
How it was gonna be  
So what'll happen to us baby  
Guess we'll have to wait and see  
  
When I find out all the reasons  
Maybe I'll find another way  
Find another day  
With all the changing seasons of my life  
Maybe I'll get it right next time  
An now that you've been broken down  
Got your head out of the clouds  
You're back down on the ground  
  
And you don't talk so loud  
An you don't walk so proud  
Any more, and what for  
  
Well I jumped into the river  
Too many times to make it home  
I'm out here on my own, an drifting all alone  
If it doesn't show give it time  
To read between the lines  
  
'Cause I see the storm getting closer  
And the waves they get so high  
Seems everything we've ever known's here  
Why must it drift away and die  
  
I'll never find anyone to replace you  
Guess I'll have to make it through, this time - oh this time  
Without you  
I knew the storm was getting closer  
And all my friends said I was high  
But everything we've ever known's here  
I never wanted it to die

"
7,Guns N' Roses,Every Rose Has Its Thorns,"We both lie silently still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
Chorus:  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Just like every night has it's dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has it's thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the dj say loves a game  
Of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know you'd be here right now  
If I could have let you know somehow  
I guess  
  
Chorus  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar remains  
  
I know I could have saved our love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
I guess  
  
Chorus

loves Jesus and America too  
She's a good girl, crazy 'bout Elvis  
loves horses and her boyfriend too  
  
It's a long day livin' in Reseda  
there's a freeway runnin' through the yard  
and I'm a bad boy, 'cause I don't even miss her  
I'm a bad boy for breakin' her heart  
  
And I'm free, I'm free fallin'  
  
All the vampires walkin' through the valley  
move west down Ventura Blvd.  
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows  
All the good girls are home with broken hearts  
  
I wanna glide down over Mulholland  
I wanna write her name in the sky  
I wanna free fall out into nothin'  
Gonna leave this world for awhile

9,Guns N' Roses,Garden Of Eden,"It's a critical solution  
And the east coast got the blues  
It's a mass of confusion  
Like the lies they sell to you  
  
You got a glass jawed toothache  
Of a mental disease  
An they be runnin' round back  
See 'em line up on their knees  
Cause the kiss ass sycophants  
Throwin' penance at your feet  
  
When they got nowhere to go  
Watch 'em come in off the streets  
While they're bangin' out front  
Inside their slammin' to the cruch  
Go on an throw me to the lions  
And the whole damn screamin' bunch  
Cause the pissed-off rip-offs  
Are' everywhere you turn  
Tell me how a generation's  
Ever s'posed to learn  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
  
I read it on a wall  
It went straight to my head  
It said Dance to the tension  
Of a world on edge  
We got racial violence  
And who'll cast the first stone  
And sex is used anyway it can be  
Sometimes when I look out  
It's hard to see the day  
It's a feelin' you can have it  
It's not mine to take away  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
But we're lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
Suck on that  
  
Looking through this point of view  
There's no way I'm gonna fit in  
Don't ya tell me what my eyes see  
Don't ya tell me who to believe in  
I ain't superstitious  
But I know when somethin's wrong  
I've been draggin' my heels  
With a bitch called hope  
Let the undercurrent drag me along  
  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
But we're lost in the garden of Eden  
  
Most organized religions make  
A mockery of humanity  
Our governments are dangerous  
And out of control  
The garden of Eden is just another graveyard  
Said if they had someone to buy it  
Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul  
  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll  
Lost in the garden of Eden  
(An we ain't talkin' about no poison apple or some missin' rib ya hear)  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
And there's no one's gonna believe this  
Said we're lost in the garden of Eden  
This fire is burnin'  
And it's out of control  
It's not a problem you can stop  
It's rock n' roll

Would ever mean so much to me  
In my heart I found the feelings that I've never shown  
Now they've got the best of me

Could ever be so close to me  
Your the only one that I've ever loved that has ever loved me

All the dreams we had would all just drift away  
You know there's nothing more to say

19,Guns N' Roses,Sweet Child O' Mine,"She's got a smile that  
It seems to me  
Reminds me of childhood memories  
Where everything  
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky  
Now and then when I see her face  
She takes me away to that special place  
And if I'd stare too long  
I'd probably break down and cry  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Sweet child o' mine  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
She's got eyes of the bluest skies  
As if they thought of rain  
I hate to look into those eyes  
And see an ounce of pain  
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place  
Where as a child I'd hide  
And pray for the thunder  
And the rain  
To quietly pass me by  
  
Oh, oh, oh

20,Guns N' Roses,The Garden,"You know you're all alone  
Your friends they aren't at home  
Everybody's gone to the garden  
As you look into the trees  
You can look but you don't see  
The flowers seem to tease you at the garden  
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care  
What's it with you man, and this garden  
  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya  
But it sure was glad to know ya  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
  
You can find it all inside  
No need to wrestle with your pride  
No you ain't losin' your mind  
You're just in the garden  
They can lead you to yourself  
Or you can throw it on the shelf  
But you know you can look inside  
For the garden  
  
I wasn't really scared  
Lost my virginity there  
To a gypsy with blond hair  
But now no one seems to care  
Like a mouse inside a maze  
Wandering 'round four days  
With a smile upon my face  
I never want to leave this place  
Only poor boys take a chance  
On the garden's song and dance  
Feel her flowers as they wrap around  
But only smart boys do without  
Turned into my worst phobia  
A crazy man's utopia  
If you're lost no one can show ya

She ain't exactly pretty  
Ain't exactly small

You could say she's got it all  
Never had a woman  
Never had a woman like you  
Doing all the things  
Doing all the things you do

Ain't no skin and bone

Weighing in at nineteen stone

And you're a whole lotta woman  
Oh honey you can do it

Wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away  
Wild, wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away  
  
I watched you suffer  
A dull aching pain  
Now you're decided  
To show me the same  
No sweeping exits  
Or offstage lines  
Could make me feel bitter  
Or treat you unkind  
  
I know I've dreamed you  
A sin n' a lie  
I have my freedom  
But I don't have much time  
Faith has been broken  
Tears must be cried  
Let's do some living  
After we die

Couldn't drag me away  
Wild, wild horses  
Couldn't drag me away

Now that I'm startin' to learn  
I feel I'm growin' old

Old pictures that I'll always see  
Time just fades the pages  
In my book of memories  
Prayers in my pocket  
And no hand in destiny  
I'll keep on movin' along  
With no time to plant my feet  
  
'Cause yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Old pictures that I'll always see  
Some things could be better  
If we'd all just let them be  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Got nothin' for me

I was never shown  
Suddenly this time I found  
I'm on the streets and I'm all alone  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Old pictures that I'll always see  
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties  
  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me  
Yesterday's got nothin' for me

They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
  
The hardest part this troubled heart has never  
Yet been through now.  
We've healed the scars that got their start  
Inside someone like you now.  
  
Well had I known or I'd been shown back  
When I longed you'd take me.  
To break the charge that brought me home  
And all that won't erase me.  
  
I never would know that I could  
No matter what you'd pay me.  
Replay the part, you stole my heart  
I should have known you're crazy.  
  
If all I knew was that with you  
I'd want someone to save me.  
It'd be enough, but just my luck,  
I fell in love and baby all that I wanted was  
  
Now I know you better,  
You know I'd know better,  
Now I know you better!  
  
So bittersweet, this tragedy won't ask for absolution,  
This melody inside of me still searches for solution,  
A twist of fate, a change of heart,  
Kills my infatuation,  
A broken heart, provides the spark for my determination,  
  
No one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.  
Ooh, no one ever told me when I was alone,  
They just thought I'd know better, better.

We come down from the wire

To a different fire  
When sometimes we get burned  
You'd think sometime we'd learn  
The one you love is the one  
That should take you higher  
You ain't got no one  
You better go back out and find her  
  
Just like children hidin' in a closet  
Can't tell what's goin' on outside  
Sometimes we're so far off the beaten track  
We'll get taken for a ride  
By a parlor trick or some words of wit  
A hidden hand up a sleeve  
To think the one you love  
Could hurt you now  
Is a little hard to believe  
But everybody darlin' sometimes  
Bites the hand that feeds  
  
When I look around  
Everybody always brings me down  
Well is it them or me  
Well I just can't see  
But there ain't no peace to found  
But if someone really cared  
Well they'd take the time to spare  
A moment to try and understand  
Another one's despair  
Remember in this game we call life  
That no one said it's fair

I think of it as home  
When there ain't enough of me  
To go around  
I'd rather be left alone  
But if I call you out of habit  
I'm out of love and I gotta have it  
Would you give it to me  
If I fit you needs  
Like when we both knew we had it  
But now the damage's done  
And we're back out on the run  
Fun how ev'rything was roses  
When we held on to the guns  
Just because you're winnin'  
Don't mean you're the lucky ones

He said, 'That's okay. '  
And then he walked away but the smile never dimmed and he said,  
'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  
You know I'm gonna be like him. '  
  
Chorus  
  
Well, he came from college just the other day,  
So much like a man, I just had to say,  
'Son, I'm proud of you. Can you sit for a while? '  
He shook his head and he said with a smile,  
'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  
See you later. Can I have them please? '  
  
Chorus  
  
I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  
I called him up just the other day.  
I said, 'i'd like to see you, if you don't mind. '  
He said, 'i'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  
But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  
It's been sure nice talkin' to you. '  
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  
He'd grown up just like me.  
My boy was just like me.

You'll find out for yourself  
No it don't really matter  
You're gonna leave this thing to  
Somebody else

Sitting in a Chinese school

I know that I'm a classic case  
Watch my disenchanted face  
Blame it on the Falun Gong  
They've seen the end and you can't hold on now  
  
Cause it would take a lot more hate than you  
To stop the fascination  
Even with an iron fist  
Our baby got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It don't really matter  
You're gonna find out for yourself  
No it don't really matter  
So you can hear now from  
Somebody else  
  
Cause it would take a lot more time than you  
I've got more masturbation  
Even with your iron fist  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
More than you got to rule the nation  
But all I got is precious time  
  
It don't really matter  
Gonna keep it to myself  
No it don't really matter  
So you can hear it now from  
Somebody else  
  
You think you got it all locked up inside  
And if you beat them all up they'll die  
Then you'll walk them home for the cells  
Then now you'll dig for your road back to hell  
And with your ? makes you stop  
As if your eyes were their eyes you can tell  
In your lack of time

34,Guns N' Roses,Coma,"See you've caught me in a coma  
And I don't think I want to  
Ever come back to this  
World again  
Kinda like it in a coma  
'Cause no one's ever gonna  
Oh make me come back to this  
World again  
  
Now I feel as if I'm floating away  
I can't feel the pressure  
And I like it this way  
But my body's calling, my body's calling  
Want me to come back to this  
World again  
  
Suspended deep in a sea of black  
I got the light at the end  
I got the bones on the mast  
Well, I've gone sailing, I've gone sailing  
I could leave so easily  
My friends are calling back to me  
I said yeah,  
They're leaving it all up to me when  
All I needed was clarity  
And someone to tell me what the fuck is going on  
Goddammit  
  
Slippin' farther and farther away  
It's a miracle how long we can stay  
In a world our minds created  
In a world that's full of shit  
  
Please understand me  
I'm climbin' through the wreckage  
Of all my twisted dreams  
And this cheap investigation  
Just can't stifle all my screams  
And I'm waiting  
At the crossroads  
Waiting for you  
Waiting for you  
Where are you  
  
No one's gonna bother me anymore  
No one's gonna mess with my head no more  
I can't understand what all the fightin's for  
But it's so nice here down off the shore  
I wish you could see this  
Cause there's nothing to see  
It's peaceful here and its fine with me  
Not like the world where I used to live  
I never really wanted to live...  
  
Zap him again...  
Zap the son of a bitch again  
  
Live your life like it's a coma  
Won't you tell me why we'd want to  
With all the reasons you give  
It's kinda hard to believe  
  
But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason  
Why you should stay  
Maybe we'd be better off without you anyway  
I got a one way ticket on your last chance ride  
Got a one way ticket to your suicide  
Got a one way ticket and there's no way out alive  
  
And all this crass communication that has left you in the cold  
Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old  
But if home is where the heart is  
Then there's stories to be told  
No, you don't need a doctor  
No one else can heal your soul  
  
Got your mind in submission  
Got your life on the line  
But nobody pulled the trigger  
They just stepped aside  
They'll be down by the water  
While you watch 'em wavin' goodbye  
  
They'll be callin' in the morning  
They'll be hanging on the phone  
They'll be waitin' for an answer  
But you know nobody's home  
And when the bells stop ringing  
It was nobody's fault but your own  
  
There were always ample warning  
There were always subtle signs  
And you would have seen them coming  
But we gave you too much time  
And when you said that no one's listening  
Why'd your best friend drop a dime  
Sometimes we get so tired of waiting for a  
Way to spend our time  
  
And it's so easy to be social  
It's so easy to be cool  
Yeah, its easy to get hungry  
When you ain't got shit to lose  
And I wish that I could help you  
With what you hope to find  
But I'm still out here waiting  
Watching reruns of my life  
When you reach the point of breaking  
Know it's gonna take some time  
To heal those broken memories  
That another man would need  
Just to survive

39,Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Don't damn me  
When I speak a piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
'Cause I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
  
Be it a song or a casual conversation  
To hold my tongue speaks  
Of quiet reservations  
Your words once heard  
They can place you in a faction  
My words may disturb  
But at least there's a reaction  
  
Sometimes I want to kill  
Sometimes I want to die  
Sometimes I want to destroy  
Sometimes I want to cry  
Sometimes I could get even  
Sometimes I could give up  
Sometimes I could give  
Sometimes I never give a fuck  
  
It's only for a while  
I hope you understand  
I never wanted this to happen  
Didn't want to be a man  
So I hid inside my world  
I took what I could find  
I cried when I was lonely  
I fell down when I was blind  
  
But don't damn me when I speak  
A piece of my mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
'Cause I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
I put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
  
How can I ever satisfy you  
An how can I ever make you see  
That, deep inside we're all somebody  
An it don't matter who you want to be  
But now I gotta smile I hope you comprehend  
For this man can say it happened  
'Cause this child has been condemned  
So I stepped into your world  
I kicked you in the mind  
An I'm the only witness  
To the nature of my crime  
  
But look at what we've done  
To the innocent and young  
Whoa listen to who's talking  
'Cause we're not the only ones  
The trash collected by the eyes  
And dumped into the brain  
Said it tears into our conscious thoughts  
You tell me who's to blame  
  
I know you don't want to hear me crying  
An I know you don't want to hear me deny  
That your satisfaction lies in your illusions  
But your delusions are yours an not mine  
We take for granted that we know the whole story  
We judge a book by it's cover  
And read what we want  
Between selected lines  
  
Don't hail me  
An don't idolize the ink  
Or I've failed in my attentions  
Can you find the missing link  
Your only validation is in living your own life  
Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time  
So I send this song to the offended  
I said what I meant and I've never pretended  
As so many others do intending just to please  
If I damned your point of view  
Could you turn the other cheek  
  
Don't damn me when I speak a piece a mind  
'Cause silence isn't golden  
When I'm holding it inside  
I've been where I have been  
An I've seen what I have seen  
Put the pen to the paper  
'Cause it's all a part of me  
Don't damn me  
I said don't damn me  
I said don't hail me  
Ah, don't damn me

Oh yaaa, just another Sunday  
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa  
  
There's too many games in a day for a simple man to face  
That desperate moment in your life where you can't be afraid  
Don't think your second chance will break around the bend  
Cause hearts don't always share love, or the person on the other  
End  
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
There's something I need to say before it's to late  
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay ya  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
It's only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday, oh yaaa  
  
Those are tickets for the same plane, bring it back to me  
Cause felling the same pain makes half the luxery  
Take a walk away won't end the carousel  
But if walking away can bring you back, then I wish you well  
You've been in my life so long, can I get through to you  
I touch you eyes and it shades my life blue  
There's something I need to say before it's to late  
But I won't hold you back, while I'm begging you to stay  
  
Just another Sunday yaa  
Just another Sunday oh baby  
It's only one more Sunday  
Just another Sunday  
It's just another Sunday  
It's just another  
Just another Sunday  
Just another oh yaa  
Just another Sunday

49,Guns N' Roses,Live And Let Die,"When you were young  
And your heart was an open book  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin' world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die  
  
What does it matter to ya  
When ya got a job to do  
Ya got to do it well  
You got to give the other fella hell  
  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin' world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die

"
50,Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness  
Yeah I'll find a way to cure the pain  
If I said that you're my friend  
And our love would never end  
How long before I had your trust again  
I opened up the doors when it was cold outside  
Hopin' that you'd find your own way in  
But how can I protect you  
Or try not to neglect you  
When you won't take the love I have to give  
I bought me an illusion  
An I put it on the wall  
I let it fill my head with dreams  
And I had to have them all  
But oh the taste is never so sweet  
As what you'd believe it is -  
Well I guess it never is  
It's these prejudiced illusions  
That pump the blood  
To the heart of the biz  
  
You know I never thought  
That it could take so long  
You know I never knew how to be strong  
Yeah, I let you shape me  
But it feels as though you raped me  
'Cause you climbed inside my world  
And in my songs  
So now I've closed the door  
To keep the cold outside  
Seems somehow I've found the will to live  
But how can I forget you  
Or try not to reject you  
When we both know it takes time to forgive  
  
Sweetness is a virtue  
And you lost your virtue long ago  
You know I'd like to hurt you  
But my conscience always tells me no  
You could sell your body on the street  
To anyone whom you might meet  
Who'd love to try and get inside  
And bust your innocence open wide  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Gonna have some fun with my frustrations  
Gonna watch the big screen in my head  
I'd rather take a detour  
'cause this road ain't gettin' clearer  
Your train of thought has cut me off again  
Better tame that boy 'cause he's a wild one  
Better tame that boy for he's a man  
Sweetheart don't make me laugh  
You's gettin' too big for your pants  
And I's think maybe you should  
Cut out while you can  
You can use your illusion -  
Let it take you where it may  
We live and learn  
And then sometimes it's best to walk away  
Me I'm just here hangin' on  
It's my only place to stay at least  
For now anyway  
I've worked too hard for my illusions  
Just to throw them all away  
  
I'm taking time quiet consolation  
In passing by this love that's passed away  
I know it's never easy  
So why should you believe me  
When I've always got so many things to say  
Calling off the dogs a simple choice is made  
'Cause playful hearts  
Can sometimes be enraged  
You know I tried to wake you  
I mean how long could it take you  
To open up your eyes and turn the page  
  
Kindness is a treasure  
And it's one towards me you've seldom shown  
So I'd say it for a good measure  
To all the ones like you I've known  
Ya know I'd like to shave your head  
And all my friends could paint it red  
'Cause love to me's a two way street  
An all I really want is peace  
  
But my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
No  
  
Affection is a blessing  
Can you find it in your sordid heart  
I tried to keep this thing ta-gether  
But the tremor tore my pad apart  
Yeah I know it's hard to face  
When all we've worked for's gone to waste  
But you're such a stupid woman  
And I'm such a stupid man  
But love like time's got its own plans  
  
'Cause my baby's got a locomotive  
My baby's gone off the track  
My baby's got a locomotive  
Got ta peel the bitch off my back  
I know it looks like I'm insane  
Take a closer look I'm not to blame  
Yeah  
If love is blind I guess I'll buy myself a cane  
  
Love's so strange

51,Guns N' Roses,Look At Your Game Girl,"There's a time for a living  
Time keeps on flying  
Think you're loving baby  
But all your doing is crying  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Look at your game, girl  
  
What a mad delusion  
Living in that confusion  
Frustration and doubt  
Can you ever live without the game?  
  
The sad, sad game  
Mad game  
Just to say loves' not enough  
Even it can't be true  
Oh, you can tell those lies, baby, but you're only fooling you  
  
Can you feel?  
Are those feelings real?  
Look at your game, girl  
Go on look at your game, girl  
  
And if you can't feel  
And those feelings aint real  
Then you better, stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
Or your gonna play cryin'  
Stop tryin'  
  
That's the game  
Sad sad game  
Mad game  
Sad game

52,Guns N' Roses,Madagascar,"I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No I won't be told anymore  
That I've been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I can't find my way back, my way anymore  
  
No, I..  
No, I...  
  
Forgive them they teared down my soul  
Bless them that they might grow old  
And free them so that they may know  
That it's never too late  
  
For the many times would seem like a memory  
I searched and found the way to choose to the end  
I found the ways, why it had to be  
Mired in denial and saw all the rain  
  
If we ever find it true  
Life we have is made to choose  
Free the ball, the chain  
We're here together  
  
I'm gonna tell you a story  
Stand up for righteousness!  
What?  
Stand up for justice!  
What?  
Stand up for truth!  
How can a person grow up with all this around them?  
You got to call on that something  
Where does it come from?  
That can make a way out of no way  
All this hatred?  
What we've got here is..  
Fear!  
That power that can make a way out of now no way  
Failure to communicate  
I tell ya I seen the lightning...I've heard the thunder roll!  
Everybody's acting like we can do anything and it don't matter what we  
Do. Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know..  
Sometimes...  
Hatred isn't somethin' you're born with  
I feel discouraged  
It gets taught  
Sometimes I feel discouraged  
I felt this fear  
He promised never to leave me, never to leave me alone, no never alone,  
No never alone!  
Let's get something straight, alright?  
Promised never to leave me!  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone!  
All men betray. All lose heart!  
I don't want to lose heart!...I want to believe  
Black men and white men  
Together at the table of brotherhood!  
I have a dream  
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God almighty!! WE ARE FREE AT LAST!!

That I've been brought down in this storm

Nice boys don't play rock and roll

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean  
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene  
She met the man and she did the smack  
Paid the price layin' flat on her back  
Wanted so bad just to please the boys  
They ended up just being a toy  
Played so hard burned her life away  
Lies were told no promises made

Hot for kicks just to get around  
But now she lays in a filthy room  
She kills the pain with  
A flick and a spoon  
And in the streets the garbage lies  
Protected by a million flies

You know that they got bones  
Moved in and made a tenement home

And it's hard to hold a candle  
In the cold November rain

Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah  
But love is always coming and love is always going  
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today  
Walking away  
  
If we could take the time  
To lay it on the line  
I could rest my head  
Just knowin' that you were mine  
All mine  
So if you want to love me  
Then darlin' don't refrain  
Or I'll just end up walkin'  
In the cold November rain  
  
Do you need some time on your own  
Do you need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
I know it's hard to keep an open heart  
When even friends seem out to harm you  
But if you could heal a broken heart  
Wouldn't time be out to charm you  
  
Sometimes I need some time on my  
Own  
Sometimes I need some time all alone  
Everybody needs some time  
On their own  
Don't you know you need some time all alone  
  
And when your fears subside  
And shadows still remain, oh yeah  
I know that you can love me  
When there's no one left to blame  
So never mind the darkness  
We still can find a way  
'Cause nothin' lasts forever  
Even cold November rain  
  
Don't ya think that you need somebody  
Don't ya think that you need someone  
Everybody needs somebody  
You're not the only one  
You're not the only one

Don't ya think that you need someone

I've been taught just to kill and fight this  
To bury it deeper where nobody can find it  
Like nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a strong compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
Ooh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than the last compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shadows  
If only you had let me know  
  
And they won't give in  
Cause they know what they're after  
A kick in the face  
Like its all that would matter  
Oh  
  
Oh my god  
I can't deny this  
I've been taught just to murder and fight this  
To bury it deeper where no one can find it  
'cause nobody wouldn't know  
  
Oh, if it opens your eyes  
This is better than a good compromise  
I was willing to be lost in the shuffle  
If only you had let me know  
  
Oh, well its on with the show  
Like the tide down on the ocean  
The waves already set in motion  
The only one in the game that's lost is you

62,Guns N' Roses,One In A Million,"Yes I needed some time to get away  
I needed some peace of mind  
Some peace of mind that'll stay  
So I thumbed it. Now it's six in L.A.  
Maybe a greyhound could be my way  
  
Police and niggers, that's right  
Get outta my way  
Don't need to buy none of your  
Gold chains today  
Now don't need no bracelets  
Clamped in front of my back  
Just need my ticket 'till then  
Won't you cut me some slack  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high.  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
Much too high...  
  
Immigrants and fagots  
They make no sense to me  
They come to our country  
And think they'll do as they please  
Like start some mini-Iran  
Or spread some fucking disease  
And they talk so many God damn ways  
It's all Greek to me  
  
Well some say I'm lazy  
And others say that's just me  
Some say I'm crazy  
I guess I'll always be  
But it's been such a long time  
Since I knew right from wrong  
It's all the means to and end I'm  
I keep it moving along  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
You're one in a million  
You're a shooting star  
You're one in a million babe  
You know that you are  
Maybe some day we'll see you  
Before you make us cry  
You know we tried to reach you  
But you were much to high  
Much too high  
Much too high  
  
Radicals and racists  
Don't point your finger at me  
I'm a small town white boy  
Just tryin' to make ends meet  
Don't need your religion  
Don't watch that much TV  
Just makin' my livin' baby  
Well that's enough for me  
  
You're one in a million  
Yeah that's what you are  
You're one in a million babe  
You're a shooting star

He's got the power - oh

You know you hate this game  
He slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain

If you can keep your sanity  
They break down the doors  
And they rape my rights but  
They won't touch me  
They scream and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me

I close my eyes  
They won't touch me  
'Cause I got somethin'  
I been buildin' up inside  
For so fuckin' long  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm fucking innocent  
They won't break me  
  
Sometimes it's easy to forget where you're goin'  
Sometimes it's harder to leave  
And every time you think you know just what you're doin'  
That's when your troubles exceed  
They push me in a corner  
Jest to get me to fight but  
They won't touch me  
They preach and yell  
And fight all night  
You can't tell me  
I lose my head  
I close my eyes  
They won't touch me

They won't break me  
  
Some people got a chip on their shoulder  
And some would say it was me  
But I didn't bey that fifth of whiskey  
That you gave me  
So I'd be quick to disagree  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent  
They won't break me  
  
They're out ta get me  
They won't catch me  
I'm innocent

If I had to deny your name?  
Where would you go if I told you  
""I love you""  
And then walk away? Oh yeah!  
N' who should I turn to  
If not for the ones

Should be careful and unafraid

Are misunderstood  
And you decide  
I'm up  
To no good  
Don't ask me to  
Enjoy them

Ask yourself  
What I would choose  
To prostitute myself  
To live with fortune and shame

When you should  
Have turned to the hearts

Spare a thought for his back breaking work.  
Say a prayer for his wife and his children,  
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth.  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd,  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.  
They don't look real to me,  
In fact, they look so strange.  
  
Raise your glass to the hard working people,  
Lets drink to the uncounted heads.  
Lets think of the wandering millions,  
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead.  
  
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter,  
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows.  
And a parade of the gray suited grafters,  
A choice of cancer or polio.  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd,  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white.  
They don't look real to me,  
In fact, they look so strange.  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people,  
Lets think of the lowly of birth.  
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people,  
Sets drink to the salt of the earth.  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people,  
Lets drink to the salt of the earth.  
Lets think of the two thousand million,  
Lets think of the humble of birth.

76,Guns N' Roses,Scraped,"[Chorus:]  
Don't you try and stop us now  
I just refuse  
Don't you try to stop us now  
'Cause I just won't let you  
  
Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me  
Breaking me down with an endless monotony  
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me  
All things are possible, I am unstoppable  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe  
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be  
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me  
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable  
  
No one can make you do what they want to  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So they convince you no one can break through  
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

choked on my own cigarette  
You can hand me another bottle of whiskey baby  
but you ain't seen the worst yet  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead  
who was out alnight, no I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing  
in the shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
shadow of your love  
  
Wrote my changes helplessly  
yeah but I got no regrets  
Money it was on the table  
so I booked with all the bets  
  
Living like a lemon ain't so hot  
and you ain't my idea  
of one high-rollin' shot  
  
No I ain't standing, never standing  
[Chorus]  
Big dark clouds hanging over your head  
hope you've heard, baby all I've said  
You've been told, what I've said  
No use crying, you're as good as dead  
  
Now I'm reckless, gonna have some fun  
and the woman who is dead, who is out alright  
now I'm not the only one  
  
And I ain't standing, never standing

You thought they'd make me, behave and submit

81,Guns N' Roses,Sympathy For The Devil,"Please allow me to introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I've been around for a long, long year  
Stole many a man's soul and faith  
  
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ  
Had his moment of doubt and pain  
Made damn sure that Pilate  
Washed his hands and sealed his fate  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
  
I stuck around St. Petersberg  
When I saw it was a time for a change  
Killed the Czar and his ministers  
Anastasia screamed in vain  
  
I rode a tank  
Held a general's rank  
When the Blitzkrieg raged  
And the bodies stank  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
What's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  
  
I watched with glee  
While your kings and queens  
Fought for ten decades  
For the Gods they made  
  
I shouted out  
""Who killed the Kennedys?""  
When after all  
It was you and me  
  
Let me please introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
And I laid traps for troubadours  
Who get killed before they reached Bombay  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah, get down, baby  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's confusing you  
Is just the nature of my game  
  
Just as every cop is a criminal  
And all the sinners saints  
As heads is tails  
Just call me Lucifer  
'Cause I'm in need of some restraint  
  
So if you meet me  
Have some courtesy  
Have some sympathy, and some taste  
Use all your well-learned politesse  
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah  
  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, um yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, um baby, get down

82,Guns N' Roses,The Blues,"All the love in the world couldn't save you  
All the innocence inside  
You know I tried so hard to make you  
To make you change your mind  
  
And it hurts too much to see you  
And how you left yourself behind  
You know I didn't want to meet you  
Now there's a hell I can't describe  
  
So now I wander through my day  
Trying to find my way  
Still these feelings that I felt  
I said to you and no one else  
  
And no it's not going to change  
I know it's gone, still I'm used  
And that's nice to hang on someone  
A change that's bittersweet  
  
That's called the blues  
  
Don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what you planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
I don't know just what I should do  
Everywhere I go I see you  
You know it's what we planned, this much is true  
What I thought was beautiful don't live inside of you, anymore  
  
What this means to me  
The more I know you believe  
What I thought was you now  
Has got more that it changed on you  
  
What I thought was true  
The more that I might know is you  
What I thought was you  
Is only memories, distant

83,Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,"Broken glass and cigarettes,  
Writing on the wall,  
It was a bargain for the summer,  
And I thought I had it all.  
I was the one who gave you everything,  
The one who took the fall,  
You were the one who would do anything,  
The one who can't recall  
Where she was while she was sleeping,  
In another woman's bed,  
Or the doctors or the lawyers,  
Or a stranger that she met.  
If there's nothing I can gain from this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the knowledge that ya gave me,  
When I thought I had it all.  
  
It was a long time with you,  
It was a long time with me,  
It'd be a long for anyone,  
But looks like it's meant to be.  
  
Social class and registers,  
Cocaine in the hall,  
All the way from California,  
On the way beyond that stall.  
To those non-negotiations  
To simulate a call,  
All the bad of learning evils and your ways around the laws that keep you  
  
Up and sitting pretty,  
On a pedestal of men  
And now you're sleeping like an angel,  
Near the man who reaped it in.  
  
If there's something I can make of this,  
Or anything at all,  
It'd be the devil hates a loser and you thought you had it all.  
  
It was a wrong time for you,  
It was a wrong time for me,  
It was the wrong time for everyone  
But looks like I'm about to see for myself.  
  
If I could go back in time to the place in my soul,there all alone  
Lonely tear drops,  
Ooh,are calling you.  
But I don't wanna know it now,  
'cause knowing you, it won't change a damn thing.  
But there was a time.  
  
Yeah, there was a time,  
Didn't wanna know it all,  
Didn't wanna know it all and  
I don't wanna know it now  
  
Oh,

Oooh and the love we shared  
Lovin' that'll last forever

85,Guns N' Roses,This I Love,"And now I don't know why  
She wouldn't say goodbye  
But then it seems that I  
Had seen it in her eyes  
  
And it might not be wise  
I'd still have to try  
With all the love I have inside  
I can't deny  
  
I just can't let it die  
'Cause her heart's just like mine  
She holds her pain inside  
  
So if you ask me why  
She wouldn't say goodbye  
I know somewhere inside  
  
There is a special light  
Still shining bright  
And even on the darkest night  
She can't deny  
  
So if she's somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
There's no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
I'm so alive  
I hoped she'd never leave me  
Please God you must believe me  
I've searched the universe  
And found myself  
Within' her eyes  
  
No matter how I try  
They say it's all a lie  
So what's the use of my  
Confessions to a crime  
Of passions that won't die  
In my heart  
  
So if she's somewhere near me  
I hope to God she hears me  
There's no one else  
Could ever make me feel  
I'm so alive  
I hoped she'd never leave me  
Please God you must believe me

Had seen it in her eyes  
And now it seems that I  
Gave up my ghost of pride  
I'll never say goodbye

And when you're high you never ever want to come down  
So down, so down, so down, yeah  
  
You know where you are?  
You're down in the jungle baby, you're gonna dieee  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Feel my, my, my serpentine  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees  
In the jungle welcome to the jungle  
Watch it bring you to you  
Its gonna bring you down, ha!!

90,Guns N' Roses,You Ain't The First,"I tried so hard just to get through to you  
But your head's so far  
From the realness of truth  
Was it just a come on in the dark  
Wasn't meant to last long  
I think you've worn your welcome honey  
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song  
  
Time can pass slowly  
Things always change  
Your day's been numbered  
And I've read your last page  
You was just a temporary love  
But honey you ain't the first  
Lots of other come before you woman  
Said but you been the worst  
Said you been the worst  
  
So goodbye to you girl  
So long, farewell  
I can't hear you cryin'  
Your jivin's been hell  
So look for me walkin'  
Down your street at night  
I'll be in with another  
Deep down inside  
Deep down inside

91,Guns N' Roses,You Could Be Mine,"I'm a cold heartbreaker  
Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two  
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed  
I'll be out the door before you wake  
It's nuthin' new to you  
'Cause I think we've seen that movie too  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
  
Now holidays come and then they go  
It's nothin' new today  
Collect another memory  
When I come home late at night  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Just count your stars I'm home again  
  
'Cause you could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine, mine, mine, mine  
  
You've gone sketchin' too many times  
Why don't you give it a rest  
Why  
Must you find  
Another reason to cry  
  
While you're breakin' down my back n'  
I been rackin' out my brain  
It don't matter how we make it  
'Cause it always ends the same  
You can push it for more mileage  
But your flaps are wearin' thin  
And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'  
But this nightmare never ends  
Don't forget to call my lawyers  
With ridiculous demands  
An you can take the pity so far  
But it's more than I can stand  
'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older  
Tell me how long has it been  
'Cause five years is forever  
And you haven't grown up yet  
  
You could be mine  
But you're way out of line  
With your bitch slap rappin'  
And your cocaine tongue  
You get nuthin' done  
I said you could be  
You should be  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine  
You could be mine
