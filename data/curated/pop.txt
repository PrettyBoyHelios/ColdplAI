[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
I got a heart, and I got a soul  
Believe me, I use them both  
We made a start, be it a false one I know  
Baby, I don't want to feel alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Verse 2: Niall Horan]  
We took a chonce, God knows we've tried  
Yet all along I knew we'd be fine  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
So pour me a drink, oh love  
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything we can  
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Zayn Malik]  
So kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
To be loved and to be in love  
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Kiss me where I lay down  
My hands pressed to your cheeks  
A long way from the playground  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
I have loved you since we were eighteen  
Long before we both thought the same thing  
  
[Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson]  
To be loved and to be in love  
  
And all I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you  
And I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen  
  
I wanna love like you made me feel  
When we were eighteen

 

[Verse 1: Niall]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because I move a little slow when I dance  
  
[Hook: Liam]  
I can count on you  
After all that we been through  
Cause I know that you'll always understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No I'll still feel the same around you  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
When I'm fat and old  
And my kids think I'm a joke  
Because the stories that I've told  
I tell again and again  
  
[Hook: Zayn]  
I can count on you  
After all we got up to  
Because I know that you'll truly understand  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
When I can hardly walk and my hair is falling out  
We'll still stay up 'til morning  
We'll throw an after party  
Oh yeah, oh yeah!  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same around you  
I won't act my age  
No, I won't act my age  
No, I'll still feel the same and you will too

 

[ 'My mother told me I should go and get some therapy  
I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me?  
I don\'t know why I wanna be with every girl I meet  
I can\'t control it  
Yeah, I know it\'s taking over me  
I\'m going crazy  
Can\'t contain it  
So tell me just what I should do?"  
  
She said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don\'t look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it\'s only for tonight"  
She said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
If it makes you feel alive"  
  
Went to a party just after the doctor talked to me  
I met a girl, I took her in up to the balcony  
I whispered something in her ear that I just can\'t repeat  
She said, "okay" but she was worried what her friends will think  
She\'s going crazy  
Can\'t contain it  
She asked me, "What should I do, oh?"  
  
I said, "Hey, it\'s alright.  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don\'t look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it\'s only for tonight"  
I said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
If it makes you feel alive"  
  
We got to live before we get older  
Do what we like  
We got nothing to lose  
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders  
Oh, we got nothing to prove  
  
I said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don\'t look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it\'s only for tonight"  
  
I said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
Does it make you feel alive?  
Don\'t look back,  
Live your life,  
Even if it\'s only for tonight"  
I said, "Hey, it\'s alright  
If it makes you feel alive"

He's memorized every part of your face  
Inside and out, baby, head to toe  
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know  
  
Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods  
The songs that you sing when you're all alone  
Your favorite band, and the way that you dance

Don't try to make me stay

Don't make me stay the night  
Or ask if I'm alright  
I don't have the answer.  
  
Heartache doesn't last forever  
I'll say I'm fine  
Midnight ain't no time for laughing  
When you say goodbye.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible.  
  
I've tried to ask myself  
Should I see someone else?  
I wish I knew the answer.  
  
But I know, if I go now, if I leave  
Then I'm on my own tonight  
I'll never know the answer.  
  
Midnight doesn't last forever  
Dark turns to light  
Heartache flips my world around  
I'm falling down, down, down,  
That's why.

And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible)  
Irresistible (Irresistible).  
  
It's in your lips and in your kiss  
It's in your touch and your fingertips  
And it's in all the things and other things  
That make you who you are and your eyes irresistible.  
  
It makes your lips so kissable  
And your kiss unmissable  
Your fingertips so touchable  
And your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
Irresistible.

 

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me  
But bear this mind it was meant to be  
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks  
And it all makes sense to me  
  
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile  
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs  
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine  
But I'll love them endlessly  
  
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth  
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to  
I'm in love with you and all these little things  
  
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea  
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep  
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep  
Though it makes no sense to me  
  
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape  
You never want to know how much you weigh  
You still have to squeeze into your jeans  
But you're perfect to me  
  
I won't let these little things slips out of my mouth  
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to  
I'm in love with you and all these little things  
  
You never love yourself half as much as I love you  
You'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to  
If I let you know, I'm here for you  
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you oh  
  
I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth  
Because it's Lou, oh it's Lou, it's Lou they add up to  
And I'm in love with Lou (and all his little things)  
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth  
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to  
I'm in love with you, and all your little things

No you, you like playing games  
  
Your hands touching me, they're touching me

[Verse 1: Niall]  
We made a fire, went down in the flames  
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the waves  
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed  
We had it all, yeah and we walked away  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around  
I try to forgive you but I struggle cause I don't know how  
We built it up so high and now I'm falling  
It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here  
  
[Verse 2: Louis]  
We had a mountain, but took it for granted  
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it  
We found an island, but we got stranded  
We had it all yeah, who could've planned it?  
  
[Chorus: Liam]  
Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around  
I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling cause I don't know how  
We built it up so high and now I'm falling  
It's a long way down from here, such a long way down from here  
It's a long way down, it's a long way down  
Such a long way down, it's a long way down, it's a long way down

 

If I don't say this now I will surely break  
As I'm leaving the one I want to take  
Forgive the urgency but hurry up and wait  
My heart has started to separate  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'll look after you  
  
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go  
Will you, won't you be the one I always know?  
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around  
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'll look after you  
  
If ever there was a doubt  
My love she leans into me  
This most assuredly counts  
She says most assuredly  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
I'll look after you  
  
It's always have and never hold  
You've begun to feel like home  
What's mine is yours to leave or take  
What's mine is yours to make your own  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Be my baby  
Oh, oh, oh

 

She's seventeen,  
And gets to thinking,  
About Prom Queen and partying,  
  
Can't get her head on straight,  
But has to try before it's too late,  
But I don't think she has a chance,  
  
I know you, you know me,  
But you're too proud to show me,  
The way you really see the world,  
  
I'm here to help,  
And I'm sure it feels like hell,  
Come take my hand we'll fly away to promised lands,  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see that this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
Please believe,  
That we aren't just here,  
Sitting watch you do your thing,  
  
You want to scream, but,  
Those chains they hold you down,  
And I won't wait to get you off the ground,  
  
Free to look forward to what is at hand,  
If there's something to ask,  
It's too short for a regret,  
  
People make mistakes,  
And I'm here to lead the way,  
To see you spread your wings.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.  
  
What are you running from?  
Why can't you just see this through?  
When you're lost in life I will try,  
Oh, I'll try, yeah, I'll try,  
To find you.

[Liam]  
You're insecure, so half of four,  
Your old brains are not what they were before,  
[Zayn]  
Add two threes, it's fine for us,  
'Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff  
  
[Harry]  
Everyone else can multiply by 60,  
Everyone else can add two  
  
[All]  
And Now take off one hundred and add on 24,  
Then divide by two and add on seven more  
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible  
  
[All]  
If only you had a mind like me  
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three,  
And then just add on the age of this OAP  
You don't know, (o oh) your maths skills are terrible (o oh)  
  
[Harry]  
It's really kinda pitiful

 

1, 2, 3  
  
Straight off the plane to a new hotel  
Just touched down, you could never tell  
A big house party with a crowded kitchen  
People talk shh but we don't listen  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everwhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
5 foot something with the skinny jeans  
Don't look back, baby follow me  
I don't know where I'm going but I'm finding my way  
Same old shh but a different day  
  
Tell me that I'm wrong but I do what I please  
Way too many people in the Addison Lee  
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, whoa  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it  
  
You and me and all our friends  
I don't care how much we spend  
Baby, this is what the night is for,  
I know nothing's making sense  
For tonight let's just pretend  
I don't wanna stop so give me more  
  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, baby you and me  
Stumbling in the street  
Singing, singing, singing, singing  
Midnight memories,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, everywhere we go never say no  
Just do it, do it, do it, do it

 

Shut the door  
Turn the light off  
If I wanna be with you  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna lay beside you  
I cannot hide this  
Even though I try  
  
Heartbeats harder  
Time escapes me  
Trembling hands touch skin  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Close the door  
Throw the key  
Don't wanna be reminded  
Don't wanna be seen  
Don't wanna be without you  
My judgement's clouded  
Like tonight's sky  
  
Hands are silent  
Voice's numb  
Try to scream out, my lungs  
It makes this harder  
And the tears stream down my face.  
  
If we could only have this life for one more day  
If we could only turn back time  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
Flashing lights in my mind  
Going back to the time  
Playing games in the street  
Kicking balls at my feet  
There's a numb in my toes  
Standing close to the edge  
There's a pile of my clothes  
At the end of your bed  
As I feel myself fall  
Make a joke of it all  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today  
  
You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be  
My love, my heart is breathing for this  
Moment, in time  
I'll find the words to say  
Before you leave me today

 

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Stained coffee cup  
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
Sweet, where you lay  
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Verse 3: Liam Payne]  
Taste, on my tongue  
I don't want to wash away the night before  
  
[Verse 4: Harry Styles]  
In the heat, where you lay  
I could stay right here and burn in it all day  
  
[Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control  
  
[Bridge: Zayn Malik]  
Lost my senses, I'm defenseless  
Her perfume's holding me ransom  
Sweet and sour, heart devoured  
Lying here I count the hours  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Waking up, beside you I'm a loaded gun  
I can't contain this anymore  
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control  
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious  
I just can't get enough of you  
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed  
No control

 

You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry  
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye  
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart  
You're tearing me apart  
  
You're so London your own style, your own style  
And together we're so good so girl why  
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart  
You're tearing me apart  
  
Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile,  
Baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on,  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
  
We're so Paris when we kissed, when we kissed  
I remember the taste of your lipstick  
Now you're tearing up my heart, tearing up my heart,  
You're tearing up my heart  
  
Did I do something stupid, yeah, girl if I blew it  
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me  
From not moving on, baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you  
Nobody compares to you  
  
There's gotta be some way to get you to want me like before  
'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress  
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight  
No one ever makes me feel like you do  
When you smile, baby tell me how to make it right  
Now all my friends say it's not really worth it  
But even if that's true  
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on  
Baby even if I wanted to  
Nobody compares to you

 

Nobody knows  
Nobody knows but me  
That I sometimes cry  
If I could pretend that I'm asleep  
When my tears start to fall  
I peek out from behind these walls  
I think nobody knows  
Nobody knows no  
Baby  
Oh the secret's safe with me  
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be  
And baby don't it feel like I'm all alone  
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown  
And I've lost my way back home  
I think nobody knows no  
I said nobody knows  
Nobody cares  
Baby  
Oh the secret's safe with me  
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be  
And baby don't it feel like I'm all alone  
Who's gonna be there after the last angel has flown  
And I've lost my way back home  
I think nobody knows no  
I said nobody knows  
Nobody cares

 

[Verse 1: Niall]  
Remember the day we were giving up when you told me I didn't give you enough  
And all of your friends were saying I'll be leaving you  
She's lying in bed with my t-shirt on, just thinking how I went about it wrong  
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam]  
Please believe me, don't you see  
The things you mean to me?  
Oh I love you, I love you  
I love, I love, I love Olivia  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
Say what you're feeling and say it now cause I got the feeling you're walking
out  
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya  
The consequences are falling now, there's something I'm having nightmares
about  
And these are the reasons I'm crying out to be with ya  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam]  
Please believe me, don't you see  
The things you mean to me?  
Oh I love you, I love you  
I love, I love, I love Olivia  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
When you go and I'm alone, you live in my imagination  
The summertime and butterflies  
All belong to your creation  
I love you, it's all I do, I love you  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
I've been idolising the light in your eyes, Olivia  
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia  
Don't let me go, don't let me go, don't let me go

 

Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
We make no mistakes  
Not even the landslide or riptide  
Could take it all the way  
  
[Zayn]  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime  
It's just right  
That we are always safe  
  
Not even the bad guys in The Dark Knight  
Could take it all the way  
  
Somehow, I feel like nothings has changed  
Right now, my heart is beating the same  
Out loud, someone's calling my name  
  
It sounds like you  
  
When I close my eyes  
All the stars align  
And you are by my side  
You are by my side  
You are by my side  
  
Once in a lifetime you were mine

 

Every path you take  
Every move you make  
It can change your life  
  
But with every breath you take  
All the tears you've wasted  
You think failure's kind  
  
Angels over you now  
Bribes you to see this out  
Cuz your not the only one  
  
Look up your almost done  
This life it can be won  
Just pull it out of you,  
And shine like the brightest sun  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life  
I'll be by your side  
  
Well if you're as kind  
And an open mind  
We will make it  
Make it through this life  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Because here's our time  
So stop your crying  
Just live your life  
I'll be by your side  
  
Well if you're as kind  
And an open mind  
We will make it  
Make it through this life

 

I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride  
Keep thinkin' of me, doin' what you like  
So girl forget about the world cause it's gon' be me and you tonight  
I wanna make you beg for it, then Imma make you swallow your pride  
  
Want to make you feel like you're the only girl in the world  
Like you're the only one that I'll ever love  
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only girl in the world...

Like I'm the only one who knows your heart  
Only one...

 

[Verse:]  
There's a lightning in your eyes, I can't deny  
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, running out of time  
Without you I'll never make it out alive  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
There's a devil in your smile it's chasing me  
And every time I turn around it's only gaining speed  
There's a moment when you finally realize  
There's no way you can change the rolling tide  
But I know, yes I know that I'll be fine  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Verse 2:]  
There's a future in my life I can't foresee  
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me  
There will always be the kind that criticize  
But I know, yes I know we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run  
  
[Bridge:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
I'd give everything that I've got for your love  
  
[Chorus:]  
This time I'm ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?  
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time I'm ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free, and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now I'm ready to run  
I'm ready to run

 

Lights go down, and  
The night is calling to me, yeah  
I hear voices  
Singing songs in the street and I know  
That we won't be going home  
For so long, for so long, but I know  
That I won't be on my own, yeah  
  
I love this feeling that right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
  
Late night spaces  
With all our friends, you and me, yeah  
Love these faces  
Just like how it used to be  
And we won't be going home  
For so long, for so long, but I know,  
I won't be on my own, on my own  
  
I'm feeling like right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
  
And I could do this forever  
Whoa, whoa  
And let's go crazy together  
Whoa, whoa  
  
Lights go down and  
I hear you calling to me, yeah  
  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me  
'Cause right now  
Everything is new to me  
You know I can't fight the feeling  
And every night I feel it  
Right now  
I wish you were here with me

 

Do you remember summer '09  
Wanna go back there every night  
Just can't lie it was the best time of my life  
Lying on the beach as the sun blew out  
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud  
Oh my my they could never shut us down  
  
I used to think that I was better alone  
Why did I ever want to let you go  
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea  
The words you whispered I will always believe  
  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me, yeah  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal show me you care  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me yeah  
  
Yeah we were together summer '09  
Wanna roll back like press and rewind  
You were mine and we never said goodbye  
  
I used to think that I was better alone (Better alone)  
Why did I ever want to let you go?(Let you go)  
Under the moonlight as we stared to the sea (Stared at the sea)  
The words you whispered I will always believe  
I want you to rock me, mmm, rock me, mmm, rock me, yeah

I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh  
  
It's a quarter to three can't sleep at all  
You're so overrated  
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall  
And he wouldn't take it  
  
All that you want's under your nose, yeah  
You should open your eyes but they stay closed, closed  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I wanna save you  
Wanna save your heart tonight  
He'll only break ya  
Leave you torn apart, oh  
I can't be no superman,  
But for you I'll be super human  
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
  
Oh now you're at home  
And he don't call  
Cause he don't adore ya  
To him you are just another doll  
And I tried to warn ya  
  
What you want, what you need  
Has been right here, yeah  
I can see that you're holding back those tears, tears  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
Up, up and away  
I'll take you with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight  
I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight

 

She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah  
Tight dress with the top cut low  
She's addicted to feeling of letting go, oh, ohoo, let it go  
  
She walks in and the room just lights up  
But she don't want anyone to know  
That I'm the only one who gets to take her home, oh, ohoo  
Take her home  
  
But everytime I tell her that I want more  
She closes the door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
Maybe she's just trying to test me  
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work  
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth  
What your worth  
  
Or maybe all her friends have told her  
Don't' get closer he'll just break your heart  
  
But either way she's teasing me  
And it's just so hard (So hard)  
  
'Cause every time I tell her how I feel  
She says it's not real  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love  
Ohoo  
  
What about all the things we said?  
Talking on the phone so late  
I can't let her get away from me (Ohh)  
  
When I say that I can't do it no more  
She's back in my door  
  
She's not afraid of all the attention  
She's not afraid of running wild  
How come she's so afraid of falling in love  
She's not afraid of scary movies  
She likes the way we kiss in the dark  
But she's so afraid of f-f-falling in love (Ohoo, ohoo)  
She's not afraid  
She's not afraid (Ohoo, ohoo)

 

I was her she was me  
We were one we were free  
And if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
  
We were young we were wrong  
We were fine all along  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
When you get to where you wanna go  
And you know the things you wanna know  
You're smiling  
When you said what you wanna say  
And you know the way you wanna play  
You'll be so high you'll be flying  
  
Though the sea will be strong  
I know we'll carry on  
Cos if there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
If there's somebody calling me on  
She's the one  
She's the one  
Yeah she's the one  
Yeah she's the one  
She's the one

 

One day you'll come into my world and say it all  
You say we'll be together even even you're lost  
One day you'll say these words  
I thought you'll never say  
You say we're better off together in our bed  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
The script was written and I could not change a thing  
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again  
One day I'll come into your world and get it right  
I'll say we're better off together here tonight  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
So I don't have to keep imagining  
  
Come on, jump out at me  
Come on, bring everything  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
I want you here with me  
Like how I pictured it  
Is it too much to ask for something great?  
  
You're all I want  
So much it's hurting  
You're all I want  
So much it's hurting

 

From the moment I met you, everything changed  
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain  
I had to take you and make you mine  
  
I would walk through the desert  
I would walk down the aisle  
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile  
Whatever it takes is fine  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
Every piece of your heart  
  
I know your hearts been broken  
But don't you give up  
I'll be there, yeah I know it  
To fix you with love  
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
Every piece of your heart  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving 'til I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
  
And I will steal us a car  
And we will drive to the stars  
I will give you the moon  
It's the least I can do if you give me the chance  
  
So put your hands up  
Cause it's a stand up  
  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
You can call me a thief  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
But you should know your part  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
I'm only here  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Because you stole my heart  
  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
So put your hands up  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Cause it's a stand up  
And I won't be leaving till I finish stealing every piece of your heart  
  
Cause you stole my heart  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Call me a thief  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
But you should know your part  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
I'm only here  
(I'm a thief, I'm a thief)  
Because you stole my heart

[Verse 1: Harry Styles]  
Who's that shadow holding me hostage?  
I've been here for days  
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never 'gonna get away?  
  
[Verse 2: Zayn Malik]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But I fear I'm getting used to  
Being held by you  
  
[Chorus: All Members]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby you got me tied down  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way  
  
[Verse 3: Louis Tomlinson]  
Who's this man that's holding your hand  
And talking about your eyes?  
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind  
  
[Verse 4: Niall Horan]  
I know they'll be coming to find me soon  
But my Stockholm Syndrome is in your room  
Yeah I fell for you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now  
Baby I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way

[Bridge: Liam Payne]

But now together we're alone  
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna' go  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby look what you've done to me  
Baby look what you've done now

[ '(I waited for a girl like you)  
  
The light shines  
It\'s getting hot on my shoulder  
I don\'t mind,  
This time it doesn\'t matter  
\'Cause your friends,  
They look good and you look better  
  
Don\'t you know all night I\'ve been waiting for a girl like you to come around,
\'round, \'round?  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look, yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
I\'m weaker  
My worlds fall and they hit the ground  
Oh life, come on head, don\'t you fail me now?  
I start to say,  
"I think I love you", but I make no sound  
  
You know \'cause all my life, I\'ve been waiting for a girl like you to come
around  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight  
With just one look, yeah  
I waited for a girl like you  
  
There is no other place that I would rather be  
Than right here with you tonight  
As we lay on the ground I put my arms around you  
And we can stay here tonight  
\'Cause there\'s so much that I wanna say, I wanna say  
  
Under the lights tonight  
You turned around, and you stole my heart  
With just one look, when I saw your face  
I fell in love  
It took a minute girl to steal my heart tonight

[Harry:]  
Written in these walls  
Are the stories that I can't explain  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here empty for days  
  
[Liam:]  
She told me in the morning  
She don't feel the same about us in her bones  
It seems to me, that when I die  
These words will be written on my stone  
  
[Zayn:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The ground beneath my feet is open wide  
The way that I've been holdin' on too tight  
With nothing in between  
  
[Harry:]  
The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm  
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)  
  
[All:]  
The story of my life, I give her hope  
I spend her love until she's broke, inside  
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)  
  
[Niall:]  
Written on these walls are  
The colors that I can't change  
I leave my heart open  
But it stays right here in it's cage  
  
[Liam:]  
I know that in the morning,  
I'll see us in the light upon a hill  
Although I am broken,  
My heart is untamed, still  
  
[Louis:]  
And I'll be gone, gone tonight  
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright  
The way that I've been holdin' on so tight  
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home  
I drive all night to keep her warm

And I've been waiting for this time to come around  
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds

[ 'My hands, your hands  
Tied up like two ships  
  
Drifting, weightless  
Waves try to break it  
I\'d do anything to save it  
Why is it so hard to say it?  
  
My heart, your heart  
Sit tight like book ends  
  
Pages between us  
Written with no end  
So many words we\'re not saying  
Don\'t wanna wait \'til it\'s gone  
You make me strong  
  
I\'m sorry if I say, "I need you"  
But I don\'t care,  
I\'m not scared of love  
\'Cause when I\'m not with you I\'m weaker  
Is that so wrong?  
Is it so wrong  
That you make me strong?  
  
Think of how much  
Love that\'s been wasted  
  
People always  
Trying to escape it  
Move on to stop their heart breaking  
But there\'s nothing I\'m running from  
You make me strong

Yeah, oh ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh  
  
Can't believe you're packing your bags  
Trying so hard not to cry  
Had the best time and now it's the worst time  
But we have to say goodbye  
  
Don't promise that you're gonna write  
Don't promise that you'll call  
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
  
Wish that we could be alone now  
If we could find some place to hide  
Make the last time just like the first time  
Push a button and rewind  
  
Don't say the word that's on your lips  
Don't look at me that way  
Just promise you'll remember  
When the sky is grey  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
  
So please don't make this any harder  
We can't take this any farther  
And I know there's nothing that I wanna change, change  
  
'Cause you were mine for the summer  
Now we know it's nearly over  
Feels like snow in September  
But I always will remember  
You were my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
You always will be my summer love  
You always will be my summer love

 

I got my first real six-string  
Bought it at the five-and-dime  
Played it till my fingers bled  
Was the summer of '69  
  
Me and some guys from school  
Had a band and we tried real hard  
Jimmy quit, Jody got married  
Shoulda known, we'd never get far  
  
Oh when I look back now  
That summer seemed to last forever  
And if I had the choice  
Yeah, I'd always want to be there  
Those were the best days of my life  
  
Oh when I look back now  
That summer seemed to last forever  
And if I had the choice  
Yeah, I'd always want to be there  
Those were the best days of my life

 

I got a lot on my plate  
So get off of my bag  
My worries are piling up  
And multiplying  
  
Ain't got a lot on  
My name and it disappears fast  
Well I should spend less  
I know I know I'm trying  
  
I can't afford to change myself  
For sleep almost every night  
So I should plan my  
Week accordingly so  
I'll feel alright  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
No I can not afford rent or to  
Call it I drive but I still got  
Champagne to help me not remember  
  
Sitting on a tall fence looking  
Down at both sides well I think  
I should just stay put and a have  
A fucking dinner. It's like all I do  
Just when I do when I need a friend  
  
Who ses I can't have everything  
I want and still eat my cake  
  
I felt like going like  
Nemo's for Monday  
Tequila for Tuesday  
We sleep thru the weekend  
Zamora to Friday whenever  
Hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older  
  
Whenever hungover cause whenevers  
Over so why don't you come over  
Before we get older

 

Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me  
Now that I'm with somebody else  
You tell me you love me  
I slept on your doorstep  
Begging for one chance  
Now that I finally moved on  
You say that you missed me all along  
  
[Chorus]  
Who do you think you are?  
Who do you think I am?  
You only love to see me breaking  
You only want me 'cause I'm taken  
You don't really want my heart  
No, you just like to know you can  
Still be the one who gets it breaking  
You only want me when I'm taken  
  
You're messing with my head  
Girl that's what you do best  
Saying there's nothing you won't do  
To get me to say yes  
You're impossible to resist  
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it  
It's like I'm finally awake  
And you're just a beautiful mistake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for showing me  
Who you are underneath  
No, thank you, I don't need  
Another heartless misery  
You think I'm doing this to make you jealous  
And I know that you hate to hear this  
But this is not about you anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that you can't have me  
You suddenly want me

 

Can't ever get it right  
No matter how hard I try  
And I've tried  
Well I put up a good fight  
But your words cut like knives  
And I'm tired  
As you break my heart again this time  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Well you're the charming type  
That little twinkle in your eye  
Gets me every time  
And well there must have been a time  
I was the reason for that smile  
Keep in mind  
As you take what's left of you and I  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me I'm a screwed up mess  
That I never listen, listen  
Tell me you don't want my kiss  
That you need your distance, distance  
Tell me anything but don't you say he's what you're missing baby  
If he's the reason you're leaving me tonight  
Spare me what you think and  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
Tell me a lie  
  
Tell me a lie

 

Another night I'm waiting for you  
Waiting for my fantasy to crash and burn  
It's you I am looking for  
Another night of summer passes  
Wide awake I'm waiting for you patiently  
I want something more...  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want me  
  
Tell me why can't you just tell me  
How you feel are you that scared of hurting me?  
I'm stronger than you know  
Are we friends are something more than just another passing moment  
I'm sure what you're looking for  
  
Light a flame and I will find you  
Call for me I'll be beside you  
You're the one I think about each day  
Just tell me that you want me  
Fall and I will run to catch you  
Look to me and I'll provide you  
With a light to guide you on your way  
Just tell me that you want you  
  
Remember last November  
When I met you in the rain  
Remember what you told me  
Are you feeling still the same  
Did you tell the truth then  
Or was it just another game  
Tell me (x3)

 

There was a time  
I was everything and nothing all in one  
When you found me  
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun  
  
I need to tell you  
How you light up every second of the day  
But in the moonlight  
You just shine like a beacon on the bay  
  
And I can't explain  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside  
And I can't describe  
But it's something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath away  
The way you look tonight  
The way you look tonight

 

You tell me that you're sad and lost your way  
You tell me that your tears are here to stay  
But I know you're only hiding  
And I just wanna see you  
  
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain  
And I can see your head is held in shame,  
But I just wanna see you smile again  
See you smile again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you  
And I'll be here for you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
I wish that I could take you to the stars  
I'd never let you fall and break your heart  
And if you wanna cry or fall apart  
I'll be there to hold you  
  
You tell me that you hurt, it's all in vain  
But I can see your heart can love again  
And I remember you laughing  
So let's just laugh again  
  
But don't burn out  
Even if you scream and shout  
It'll come back to you, back to you  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
And you don't need  
You don't need to worry  
And you will see it's easy to be loved  
I know you wanna be loved  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down on you  
We will find a way through the dark  
  
Oh I will carry you over  
Fire and water for your love  
And I will hold you closer  
Hope your heart is strong enough  
When the night is coming down  
We will find a way through the dark

 

Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
Flying in the wind  
With the sun to our backs  
We can't see the shadows  
And we can't go back  
  
Cause  
  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I love you baby  
  
They can say what they want  
They can say what they feel  
But they can't change the way that the I want  
And the way this love is real  
  
Oh tonight is gonna be perfect  
If you're with me  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because I adore you  
I love you oh  
Tonight is gonna be perfect if you're by my side  
Tonight is gonna be perfect  
Because you're making me smile.

 

Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and  
You're never coming round  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit tired of  
Listening to the sound of my tears  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that  
The best of all the years have gone by  
  
Niall:  
(Turn around)  
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified  
And then I see the look in your eyes  
Nial y Louis:  
(Turn around, bright eyes)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I fall apart  
  
Niall y Louis:  
(Turn around, bright eyes)  
  
Liam:  
Every now and then I fall apart  
  
Todos:  
And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever  
And if you only hold me tight We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right 'cause we'll never  
Be wrong  
Together we can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
  
(Niall: all of the time)  
  
Todos:  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight, forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Louis y Liam:  
Once upon a time I was falling in love, but now I'm only  
Falling apart  
  
Zayn:  
There's nothing I can do... A total eclipse of the heart

 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
I've been roaming around,  
I was looking down at all I see  
Painted faces, fill the places I can't reach  
  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah-yeah  
  
Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak  
Countless lovers undercover of the streets  
  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah  
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah  
  
Someone like you  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep  
Waging wars to shape, the poet and the beat  
  
I hope it's going to make you notice  
I hope it's going to make you notice  
  
Someone like me  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like me  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) someone like me  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now  
I'm ready now,  
  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now,  
I'm ready now, I'm ready now  
  
One, two, three, four  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you  
  
Somebody  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh) Someone like you  
  
Somebody  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
I've been running around, I was looking down at all I see

 

There once was a group with Liam and Niall  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Did you know Harry's such a slob?  
He needs to win X Factor 'cause he can't get a job  
And Oh, Louis needs a boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
'Cause he's got no other clothes  
They really need your vote  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
  
Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad  
Vas Happenin' mum? Vas Happenin' Mick?  
  
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad  
Vas Happenin' song? Vas Happenin' sad?  
  
And Zayn's the master of echoes  
And Niall was raised by leprechauns  
So he won't ever grow  
And Oh, Louis needs that boat  
He dresses like he owns one  
And it's becoming a joke  
They really need your vote  
  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?  
Vas Happenin' boys? Vas Happenin' boys?

 

[ 'Liam: I used to rule the world seas would rise when I  
Gave the word now in the morning I sleep alone sweep the  
Streets that I used to own.  
Zayn: I used to roll the dice feel the fear in my enemies  
Eyes listen as the crowd would sing now the old king is  
Dead long live the king  
All: I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing roman cavalry  
Choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and sheald my  
Missionaries in a foriegn field

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire  
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light  
In her eyes there's no lies, no lies  
There's no question, she's not in a disguise  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I can't hold you, too close now  
Through the wire, through the wire  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire  
I'm watching you like this, imagining you're mine  
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late?  
Tell me now, am I running out of time?  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
With no way out and a long way down  
Everybody needs someone around  
But I can't hold you too close now  
Through the wire, through the wire  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now  
  
[Bridge: Harry]  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back, don't let 'em tie you down  
Whatever chains are holding you back  
Holding you back, tell me you believe in that  
  
[Chorus: All]  
What a feeling to be right here beside you now  
Holding you in my arms  
When the air ran out and we both started running wild  
The sky fell down  
But you've got stars, they're in your eyes  
And I've got something missing tonight  
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow  
I wish I could be there now, I wish I could be there now

 

I know you want, know you wanna take it slow  
Think about all the places we could go  
If you give in tonight  
Just let me set you free  
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Say the word, say the word but don't say no  
Skydive, you and I, with just these clothes  
The secret's safe with me  
There's no right time or place  
'Cause anyone can see we'll do it anyway  
  
'Cause we got all night  
We're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
Hey, I don't want you to be the one that got away  
I wanna get addicted to you, yeah  
You're rushing through my mind, I wanna feel the high  
I wanna be addicted, don't say no  
Just let go  
  
'Cause we got all night  
And we're going nowhere  
Why don't you stay  
Why don't we go there?  
Let's take a ride  
Out in the cold air  
I know the way, why don't you go there with me?  
  
With me, with me  
Why don't you go there with me?

 

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda, somehow, realized what you gotta do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
Back beat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
  
And all the roads we have to walk are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would like to say to you  
But I don't know how  
  
Because maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall  
  
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you  
By now you shoulda somehow realized what you've got to do  
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now  
I said maybe  
You're gonna be the one that saves me  
And after all  
You're my wonderwall

 

[Verse 1]  
[Niall]  
I figured it out  
I figured out from black and white  
Seconds and hours  
Maybe we had to take some time  
  
[Liam]  
I know how it goes  
I know how it goes from wrong and right  
Silence and sound  
Did they ever hold each other tight, like us?  
  
Did they ever fight, like us?  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the Gods above  
Can separate the two of us  
No, nothing can come between You and I  
  
Oh, you and I  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Zayn]  
I figured it out  
Saw the mistakes of up and down  
Meet in the middle  
There's always room for common ground  
  
[Louis]  
I see what it's like  
I see what it's like for day and night  
Never together  
'Cause they see things in a different light, like us  
  
But they never tried, like us  
  
[Chorus]  
[Harry]  
You and I  
We don't want to be like them  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
[Zayn]  
'Cause you and I!!!  
  
[Chorus]  
[All]  
We don't want to be like them,  
We can make it 'till the end  
Nothing can come between  
You and I  
  
Not even the  
Gods above  
Can separate the  
Two of us  
  
No, nothing can come between  
You and I  
Oh, You and I  
You and I  
  
[Outro]  
We can make it if we try  
You and I  
Oh  
You and I

 

You're insecure  
Don't know what for  
You're turning you're head when you walk through the do-o-or  
Don't need make up  
To cover up  
Being the way that you are is eno-o-ough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby,you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell yo don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful  
  
So cc-come on you got it wrong  
To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong  
I don't know why you're being shy  
And turn away when I look into you're ey-ey-eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it  
Everyone else but you,yeah  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
If only you saw what I can see  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe  
You don't know  
Oh!Oh!  
You don't know you're beautiful  
But that's what makes you beautiful!

 

[ 'Maybe it\'s the way she walked (Wow)  
Straight into my heart and stole it  
Through the doors and past the guards (Wow),  
Just like she already owned it  
  
I said, "Can you give it back to me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can\'t remember  
How it goes but I know that I won\'t forget her  
\'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh, oh, oh  
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
Said her name was Georgia Rose, (Wow)  
And her daddy was a dentist  
Said I had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)  
But she kissed me like she meant it  
  
I said, "Can I take you home with me?"  
She said, "Never in your wildest dreams"  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can\'t remember

And you know, I know, you know I\'ll remember you, (Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah,

And I know, you know, I hope you\'ll remember how we danced how we danced  
How we danced how we danced (1, 2, 1, 2, 3)  
  
How we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line, now I can\'t remember  
How it goes but I know that I won\'t forget her  
\'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever (We danced, we danced, it
goes something like, yeah)

The end of the night  
We should say goodbye  
But we carry on  
While everyone's gone  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go  
So baby if you say you want me to stay  
Stay for the night  
I'll change my mind  
  
Lean in when you laugh  
We take photographs  
There's no music on  
But we dance along  
  
Never felt like this before  
Are we friends or are we more  
As I'm walking towards the door  
I'm not sure  
  
But baby if you say you want me to stay  
I'll change my mind  
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walking away  
If you'll be mine  
Won't go, won't go

We'll do it all  
Everything  
On our own  
We don't need  
Anything  
Or anyone  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
I don't quite know  
How to say  
How I feel  
Those three words  
Are said too much  
They're not enough  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
Let's waste time  
Chasing cars  
Around our heads  
I need your grace  
To remind me  
To find my own  
If I lay here  
If I just lay here  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?  
Forget what we're told  
Before we get too old  
Show me a garden  
That's bursting into life  
All that I am  
All that I ever was  
Is here in your perfect eyes  
They're all I can see  
I don't know where  
Confused about how as well  
Just know that these things  
Will never change for us at all  
If I lay here  
If I just lay her  
Would you lie with me  
And just forget the world?

 

Been a lot of places  
I've been all around the world  
Seen a lot of faces  
Never knowing where I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know  
I know the sun will be rising  
Back home  
  
Living out of cases,  
Packing up and taking off  
Made a lot of changes  
But not forgetting who I was  
  
On the horizon  
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know,  
I know the moon will be rising  
Back home  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
I've been away for ages  
But I've got everything I need  
I'm flicking through the pages  
I've written in my memory  
  
I feel like I'm dreaming  
Oh, so I know, I know, I know,  
I know that I'm never leaving  
No, I won't go  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Lights off when they should be on  
Even stars and skies above  
Short days when the nights are long  
When I think of the days I've gone  
Don't matter how far I've gone  
I'll always be around oh  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own  
Never, never  
  
Don't forget where you belong, home  
Don't forget where you belong (don't forget it), home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Home  
Don't forget it  
Home  
If you ever feel alone, don't  
You were never on your own (you were never)  
And the proof is in this song  
  
Never forget it  
This song  
Don't forget it!  
No, I never forget it  
This song  
You were never

 

[Verse 1: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
Down  
Ever since you came around  
Everybody wanna drag us down  
Is it cause we look too happy?  
I'll never forget when you looked at me  
And told me it was all mine  
I remember that, like yesterday  
It was a summer night on the west side  
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah  
We crossed paths like an intersection  
Now we both headed in one direction  
  
[Chorus: Liam and All]  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
All my life, you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
  
[Verse 2: Harry]  
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark  
You've never seen it look so easy  
I got a river for a soul, and baby you're a boat  
Baby you're my only reason  
  
[Verse 3: Louis]  
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left  
The shell of a man who could never be his best  
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun  
You taught me how to be someone, yeah  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody, nobody  
Nobody, nobody  
  
[Verse 4: Lunchmoney Lewis]  
She a work of art like Van Gogh  
I'm underground like Camp Lo  
Yeah I'm top of them pop charts  
But I'm still saggin' my pants low  
I don't do meetings, I cancel  
One D let me get some of them fans though  
Just a young nigga from Dade County  
Where they move chickens like Nando  
When I touch down in London town  
I be sippin' tea with Simon Cowell  
Fact, shout out to Skepta, we shut it down  
Y'all lame niggas can't drag me down  
  
[Chorus: All]  
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me  
All these lights, they can't blind me  
With your love, nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down  
Nobody can drag me down

 

I'm thinking of you tonight  
And there's nothing that I want more  
Than to be by your side  
And let you grab so tight to me  
As you whisper the words good night to me  
Late at night  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
Your heart is fixing me  
Without saying anything  
My worries fall like rain  
As these melodies run through your veins  
Let me take you far - just hold onto me  
  
And we'll take this world and you will see  
That in the end, I'll be there for you  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake  
  
There's a sunshine floating  
I see clearly now  
So clearly now  
There's so much more  
That I hoped I'd ever find  
  
I love you, it's true  
You mean everything to me  
Words cannot explain how I feel  
I must be dreaming when I'm awake

 

My minds at erase  
And my thoughts are done  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
Since my lies begun  
The way I feel inside  
Reflects of the souls in your eyes  
I've been meaning to tell you this  
All of my life  
To think of who I am  
Shows much of what you were too  
Slowly I realize  
I'll be fine without you  
I gave you your chances  
And you just put them aside  
To find out too late  
Of who I am inside  
  
Show me yourself come show me who you are  
These are the times we wish it never went this far  
Hidden by your words oh god please let me see  
How someone plays with feelings oh so carelessly  
Give me your heart to come and be in one  
Vulnerable I was please come and steal and run  
Just as we laughed, kissed I looked deep in your eyes  
To tell you how I felt, came one without reply  
  
Echos is all I hear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go is all I fear I'm running, I'm running, I'm running  
Let go  
I can't let go  
So fall away is what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do  
It's what I'll do

 

[Verse 1]  
  
[Harry]  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
Something deep inside me I can't give up  
I think I'm gonna lose my mind  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
I roll and I roll till I'm out of luck  
  
[Niall]  
I'm feeling something deep inside  
Hotter than the dead stream burning up  
I got a feeling deep inside  
It's taking, it's taking all I've got  
Yeah, it's taking, its taking all I've got  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
Cos nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
Maybe we're fireproof  
  
[Liam]  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Verse 2]  
  
[Louis]  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
Riding on a wind and I won't give up  
I think I'm gonna win this time  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
I roll and I roll till I change my luck  
  
[Zayn]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
It's been so long, it's been so long  
You must be fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do  
  
[Bridge]  
[All]  
Cos nobody knows you baby the way I do  
And nobody loves you baby the way I do  
  
[Outro]  
  
[Zayn]  
It's been so long it's been so long  
  
[Harry]  
Maybe we're fireproof  
Cos nobody sees me baby the way you do

 

[Liam]  
Let's dance in style,  
Let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies,  
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
[Harry]  
Let us die young or let us live forever,  
We don't have the power but we never say never,  
Sitting in a sandpit,  
Life is a short trip,  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever,  
Forever young?  
  
[Niall]  
Some are like water, some are like the heat,  
Some are a melody and some are the beat,  
But sooner or later they all will be gone,  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
[Harry]  
It's hard to get old without a cause,  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse,  
Youth is like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever.  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[Liam]  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play,  
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue,  
We let 'em come true.  
  
[Harry]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
  
[All]  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young.  
Do you really wanna live forever,  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever  
Or never?  
Forever young,  
I wanna be  
Forever young (forever).  
Do you really wanna live forever (forever),  
Forever (forever),  
Forever young...

[ 'In Mullingar, Westmeath born and raised  
At Nando\'s, is where I spent most of my days  
Chilling out, Maxing, Relaxing all cool then I go eat  
Some chicken outside the school.  
When a couple of chavs, they were up to no good  
They started making trouble in my neighborhood.  
I got in one little fight and my mom started objectin\'  
She said "Your moving to London and joining one direction.  
I made it through auditions, thanks to Katy Perry  
And that\'s where I met Lou, Zayn, Liam, and Harry.  
And now who would\'ve thought that we\'ve come this far!  
I\'m sure as hell not going back to Mullingar.

'] 

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah  
  
[Verse 2: Harry Styles]  
No, she floats through the room on a big balloon  
Some say she's such a fake  
That her love is made up, no  
No, no, no  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall Horan]  
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty  
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightning  
  
[Chorus]  
[Zayn] Am I the only  
Only believer?

There's something happening here  
There's something happening here  
[Zayn] The only, only believer  
[All Members]  
There's something happening here  
I hope you feel what I'm feeling too  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
I'd get down, I'd get down  
I'd get down on my knees  
I'd get down on my knees for you  
  
[Verse 1: Louis Tomlinson]  
Her light is as loud as as many ambulances  
As it takes just to save a savior, oh  
Woah, woah, woah

[Liam:]  
Girl I see it in your eyes you're disappointed  
'Cause I'm the foolish one that you anointed with your heart  
I tore it apart  
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence  
And no woman in the world deserves this  
But here I am asking you for one more chance  
  
[Harry:]  
Can we fall, one more time?  
Stop the tape and rewind  
Oh and if you walk away I know I'll fade  
Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Liam:]  
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles  
When you speak to me I don't resemble, who I was  
You've almost had enough  
And your actions speak louder than words  
And you're about to break from all you've heard  
Don't be scared, I ain't going no where  
  
[Zayn:]  
I'll be here, by your side  
No more fears, no more crying  
But if you walk away  
I know I'll fade  
'Cause there is nobody else  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
  
[Zayn:]  
Oh girl, can we try one more, one more time?  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more time  
I'll make it better  
One more, one more, can we try?  
One more, one more  
Can we try one more time to make it all better?  
  
[Harry:]  
'Cause it's gotta be you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
It's gotta be you  
Only you  
It's gotta be you  
Only you

 

So your friend's been telling me  
You've been sleeping with my sweater  
And that you can't stop missing me  
Bet my friend's been telling you  
I'm not doing much better  
'Cause I'm missing half of me  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Forget all we said that night  
No, it doesn't even matter  
'Cause we both got split in two  
If you could spare an hour or so,  
We'll go for lunch down by the river  
We can really talk it through  
  
And being here without you is like I'm waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
'Cause I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Half a heart without you,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Though I try to get you out of my head  
The truth is I got lost without you  
And since then I've been waking up to  
  
Only half a blue sky  
Kinda there but not quite  
I'm walking around with just one shoe  
I'm half a heart without you  
I'm half a man at best,  
With half an arrow in my chest  
I miss everything we do,  
I'm half a heart without you  
  
Without you, without you, half a heart without you  
Without you, without you, I'm half a heart without you

 

Baby, you got me sick  
I don't know what I did  
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah  
  
Got your voice in my head  
Saying let's just be friends  
Can't believe the words came out of your mouth  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Baby, now that you're gone  
I can't stand dumb love songs  
Missing you is all I'm thinking about, yeah  
Everyone's telling me I'm just too blind to see  
How you messed me up, I'm better off now  
  
I'm trying to be okay, I'm trying to be alright  
But seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
And I'm like  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
Every time you look like that  
You're giving me a heart attack  
'Cause seeing you with him just don't feel right  
  
Ow, never thought it'd hurt so bad  
Getting over you  
Ow, you're giving me a heart attack  
Looking like you do  
'Cause you're all I ever wanted  
Thought you would be the one that's  
Ow, giving me a heart attack  
Getting over you  
  
You're all I ever wanted  
Every time you look like that  
You're all I ever wanted  
You're giving me a heart attack

 

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Make a little conversation  
So long I've been waiting  
To let go of myself and feel alive  
  
[Niall]  
So many nights I thought it over  
Told myself I kind of liked her  
But there was something missing in her eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
So hot that I couldn't take it  
Want to wake up and see your face  
And remember how good it was being here last night  
  
[Louis]  
Still high with a little feeling  
I see the smile as it starts to creep in  
It was there, I saw it in your eyes  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Harry]  
I was stumbling, looking in the dark  
With an empty heart  
But you say you feel the same  
Could we ever be enough?  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
And it's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home  
I'll make this feel like home  
  
[Harry]  
Baby we could be enough  
  
[All]  
It's alright  
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight  
When you're lost, I'll find a way  
I'll be your light  
You'll never feel like you're alone  
  
[Louis]  
I'll make this feel like home

I keep playing it inside my head,  
All that you said to me.  
I lie awake just to convince myself,  
This wasn't just a dream.  
  
'Cause you were right here,  
And I should've taken the chance.  
But I got so scared,  
And I lost the moment again.  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I can't believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
Every morning when I leave my house,  
I always look for you.  
Yeah, I see you every time I close my eyes,  
What am I gonna go?  
  
And all my friends say that I'm punching over my weight  
But in my eyes i saw how you're looking at me  
It's all that I can think about,  
Oh, you're all that I can think about  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
  
When you stood there, just a heartbeat away  
When we were dancing, and you looked up at me  
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way  
If I could replay I would never have let you go  
No, oh, never have let you go  
Am I out of time?  
  
Is your heart taken?  
Is there somebody else on your mind?  
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused,  
Just tell me, am I out of time?  
Is your heart breaking?  
How do you feel about me now?  
I cant believe I let you walk away when  
When, I should have kissed you  
  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should, I should, oh, I should have kissed you  
I should have kissed you

 

[Verse 1: Harry]  
I wanna write you a song  
One that's beautiful as you are sweet  
With just a hint of pain for the feeling that I get when you are gone  
I wanna write you a song  
  
[Verse 1: Liam]  
I wanna lend you my coat  
One that's as soft as your cheek  
So when the world is cold you'll have a hiding place you can go  
I wanna lend you my coat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
I wanna build you a boat  
One that's strong as you are free  
So any time you think that your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't  
I wanna build you a boat  
  
[Chorus: Louis]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Chorus: Harry]  
Everything I need I get from you  
And giving back is all I wanna do  
  
[Verse 3: Niall]  
I wanna write you a song  
One to make your heart remember me  
So any time I'm gone, you can listen to my voice and sing along  
I wanna write you a song, I wanna write you a song

 

Lately I found myself thinking  
Been dreaming about you a lot  
And up in my head I'm your boyfriend  
But that's one thing you've already got  
  
He drives to school every morning  
While I walk alone in the rain  
He'd kill me without any warning  
If he took a look in my brain  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would, I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Back in my head we were kissing  
I thought things were going alright  
With a sign on my back saying kick me  
Reality ruined my life  
  
Feels like I'm constantly playing  
A game that I'm destined to lose  
Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend  
He's got 27 tattoos  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
Would he please you?  
Would he kiss you?  
Would he treat you like I would?  
Would he touch you?  
Would he need you?  
Would he love you like I would?  
  
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E?  
Well if it was me then  
I would, I would  
Would he hold you when you're feeling low  
Baby you should know that I would  
  
I would, I would yeah.

 

Tell me you believe in love  
It's not an illusion...  
  
[Verse 1: Liam:]  
I've been thinking about the nights  
And the dangerous tricks people play on the eyes of the innocent  
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke  
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them  
  
[Hook: Harry]  
But believe me, I'm not trying to deceive you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Verse 2: Liam]  
You don't ever have to worry about me, about how the cards fall  
I'm all that you need tonight  
I would never turn your heart into broken parts  
You don't have to think twice looking in my eyes  
  
[Hook: Louis]  
Can't you see it? I'm not trying to mislead you  
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake  
  
[Chorus: Zayn]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
  
[Bridge: Niall]  
You can tie me up in chains  
You can throw away the key  
But there's no trap doors, I'm not gonna leave  
You're the truth I can't explain  
You're the only one I see  
It's not an illusion to me  
  
[Chorus: All]  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve  
Oh baby, this is not an illusion  
There's magic between you and me  
No baby, this is not an illusion  
You've really got me lifted off my feet  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion to me  
So tell me you believe in love  
'Cause it's not an illusion

 

Well you done done me and you bet I felt it  
I tried to beat you but you're so hot that I melted  
I fell right through the cracks, now I'm trying to get back  
  
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest  
And nothings going to stop me but divine intervention  
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait, I'm yours  
  
Well open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love  
  
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing  
We're just one big family, and  
It's our god-forsaken right to be loved, love, loved, love, loved  
  
So I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm sure  
There's no need to complicate, our time is short  
This is our fate, I'm yours  
  
D-d-do you, but you, d-d-do  
But do you want to come on  
Scooch on over closer dear  
And I will nibble your ear  
  
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror  
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer  
But my breath fogged up the glass  
And so I drew a new face and laughed  
  
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason  
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons  
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue  
  
But I won't hesitate no more, no more  
It cannot wait I'm yours  
  
Come on and open up your mind and see like me  
Open up your plans and damn you're free  
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours  
  
So please don't, please don't, please don't  
There's no need to complicated  
Cause our time is short  
This is, this is, this is our fate, I'm yours!

 

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Down to Earth  
Keep on falling when I know it hurts  
Going faster than a million miles an hour  
Trying to catch my breath some way, somehow  
Down to Earth  
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns  
Stuck in motion, but the wheels keep spinning 'round  
Moving in reverse with no way out  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Eyes can't shine  
Unless there's something burning bright behind  
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine  
I feel myself running out of time  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis Tomlinson]  
And now I'm one step closer to being  
Two steps far from you  
When everybody wants you  
Everybody wants you  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity  
  
[Chorus: Harry Styles]  
How many nights does it take to count the stars?  
That's the time it would take to fix my heart  
Oh, baby, I was there for you  
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah  
How many nights have you wished someone would stay?  
Lie awake only hoping they're okay  
I never counted all of mine  
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity  
Infinity, infinity, yeah  
Infinity

 

Friday night and everyone's moving.  
I can feel the heat but it's soothing.  
Heading down, I search for the beat in this dirty town.  
  
Down town the young ones are going.  
Down town the young ones are growing.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
Bright ligths the music get faster.  
Look boy, don't check on your watch, not another glance.  
I'm not leaving now, honey not a chance.  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.  
  
We're the kids  
We're the kids  
We're the kids in America  
  
We're the kids in America.  
We're the kids in America.  
Everybody live for the music-go-round.

Girl, it should be me  
Driving to your house  
Knocking on your door  
Kissing you on the mouth  
Holding on your hand  
Dancing in the dark  
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start  
  
But now when I see you with him it  
Tears my world apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most,  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first (I loved you first, loved you first)  
  
Girl, it should be me  
Calling on your phone  
Saying you're the one, and that I'll never let you go  
I never understood, what love was really like,  
But I felt it for the first time looking in your eyes  
But now when I see you with him  
My whole world falls apart  
  
Because,  
I've been waiting  
All this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.  
Had my chances  
Could've been where he is standing  
That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know  
Baby, I loved you first  
  
The first touch  
The first kiss  
First girl to make me feel like this  
Heartbreak  
It's killing me  
I loved you first, why can't you see?  
  
I've been waiting all this time to finally say it  
But now I see your heart's been taken  
And nothing could be worse  
Baby, I loved you first.

That's what hurts the most  
Girl, I came so close  
But now you'll never know

I'm gonna make a change,  
For once in my life  
It's gonna feel real good,  
Gonna make a diference  
Gonna make it right...  
  
As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets,  
With not enought to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs  
  
A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know  
  
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you wanna make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change  
(Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah)

 

Guess this means you're sorry  
You're standing at my door  
Guess this means you take back  
All you said before  
Like how much you wanted  
Anyone but me  
Said you'd never come back  
But here you are again  
  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you  
'Cause we belong together now, yeah  
Forever united here somehow, yeah  
You got a piece of me  
And honestly,  
My life (my life) would suck (would suck) without you

I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Yeah, I know it's hard to remember that they tried out separately  
It's even harder to picture, they placed at number 3  
Harry loves to get naked, but the boys never mind  
As soon as they got famous, all the fan girls broke down  
Twitcams make me smile  
Someone should tell Niall to hide his profile  
I'd let Larry Stylinson prank call my friends  
Six are: s in Terrance  
Zayn's no pedophile  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Everytime I read a new fanfic  
Louis munching on some carrot sticks  
Why is Harry's hair always perfect?  
Liam's only got 1 kidney left  
Yeah, we better thank Simon Cowell for making the boys stay  
Louis drove the van so slow  
They got stopped twice that day  
Zayn has such beautiful eyes  
And perfectly coiffed hair  
There are women in Sweden  
Who wouldn't put their shirts down  
Video diaries  
Superman Louis  
Liam love Danielle Pea-zer and  
Zayn loves Perrie  
Niall and his guitar  
Louis and Eleanor  
The kazoo and Harry  
I'm at a Nando's, trying to Paul home  
All of my change I spent on Lou  
Where have his socks gone?  
Niall it's all wrong  
You ate the food we made for 2  
Zayn should probably work on his dance moves  
Niall is a big fan of the zoo  
Harry used to share a flat with Lou  
Liam won't go near another spoon  
Now I'm at a Nando's

 

[Verse 1: Liam]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget  
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit  
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge  
Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Niall]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
  
[Verse 2: Niall]  
Wanna pull an all nighter and get into something we'll never forget

Wanna wake up with you and say baby let's do it all over again  
  
[Pre-Chorus: Louis]  
Lips so good I forget my name  
I swear I could give you everything  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on  
  
[Bridge]  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Too much is never enough, too much is never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
Never enough, never enough  
  
[Chorus: All]  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
I don't need my love, you can take it, you can take it, take it  
I don't need my heart, you can break it, you can break it, break it  
I just can't get too much of you, baby, it's never, it's never enough  
Never enough, it's never enough, never enough  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on

 

[ 'In West Philadelphia I was born and raised  
On the playground is where I spent most of my days  
Chillin\' out, maxin\', relaxin\' all cool,  
And all shootin\' some b-ball outside of the school  
  
When a couple of guys who where up to no good  
Started makin\' trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared,  
And said "You\'re movin\' with your auntie and uncle in bell air".

'] 

You're insecure,  
Don't know what for,  
You're turning heads when you walk through the door,  
Don't need make-up, to cover up,  
Being the way that you are is enough  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
So come on, you got it wrong,  
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song,  
I don't know why, you're being shy,  
And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes  
  
Everyone else in the room can see it,  
Everyone else but you  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,  
You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful, oh oh,  
That's what makes you beautiful  
  
(Na na na na na na na)  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful  
  
Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
You don't know, oh oh,  
You don't know you're beautiful,  
If only you saw what I can see,

[Verse 1: Niall Horan]  
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one  
Standing out from the list of the things I've done  
All the rest of my crimes don't come close  
To the look on your face when I let you go  
So I built you a house from a broken home  
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke  
It took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Verse 2: Liam Payne]  
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue  
Is at the top of the list of the things I want  
Mind is running in circles of you and me  
Anyone in between is the enemy  
  
[Verse 3: Harry Styles]  
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from  
Love was something you never heard enough  
Yeah it took me some time but I figured out  
How to fix up a heart that I let down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
[Bridge: Harry Styles]  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid  
Tell me now, tell me now  
Tell me will you ever love me again, love me again  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now I'm searching every lonely place  
Every corner calling out your name  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
Where do broken hearts go?  
  
Are you sleeping baby by yourself  
Or are you giving it to someone else  
Tryin to find you but I just don't know  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go?  
Tell me where you're hiding out  
Where do broken hearts go  
  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
(Louis Tomlinson)  
Where do broken hearts go  
Tell me cause I'm ten feet down  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, come and get me out  
Come on baby, cause I need you now  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go  
Where do broken hearts go

 

It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside  
I'm not one of those who can easily hide  
I don't have much money, but boy if I did  
I'd buy a big house where we both could live  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that  
I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross  
But the sun's been quite kind while  
I wrote this song  
It's for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done  
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

 

It's alright to cry even my dad does sometimes  
So don't wipe your eyes  
Tears remind you you're alive  
It's alright to die cause death the only thing you haven't tried  
But just for tonight hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
It's alright to shake  
Even my hand does sometimes  
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light  
It's alright to say that death's  
The only thing you haven't tried  
But just for today hold on  
So live life like you're giving all  
Cause you act like you are  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path  
  
Go ahead and just live it up  
Go on and tell me your path and hold on

 

We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been  
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives  
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?  
I never know, no one wants it to  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
We're not friends, we could be anything  
If we tried to keep those secrets safe  
No one will find out if it all went wrong  
They'll never know what we've been through  
  
So I could take the back road  
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home  
And if you know me like I know you  
You should love me, you should know  
  
Friends just sleep in another bed  
And friends don't treat me like you do  
Well I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
  
But then again, if we're not friends  
Someone else might love you too  
And then again, if we're not friends  
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why  
  
Friends should sleep in other beds  
And friends should kiss me like you do  
And I know that there's a limit to everything  
But my friends won't love me like you  
No, my friends won't love me like you  
Oh, my friends will never love me like you

 

Will you recognise me, in the flashing lights  
I try to keep my heart beat, but I can't get it right  
Will you recognise me, when I'm laying on my back  
Something's gone inside me, and it 'aint coming back, now  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah  
Then I'm gone (x7) woo woo woo wooo  
  
Will you recognise me, when I'm stealing from the poor  
You're not gonna' like me, no I'm nothing like before, wow  
And will you recognise me, when I lose another friend  
Will you learn to leave me, or give me one more try again  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, woah, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, now  
Then I'm gone (x7) now woo woo woo wooo  
  
Baby be mine, now, mm, mm, mmm  
  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, mm, then I'm gone  
Oh heaven, oh heaven, I wait with good intention, now  
But the day, it always lasts too long, wow  
Then I'm gone (x19)  
  
Baby be mine, oh, woah, wow

 

Could I wake up next to you when it's hitting double figures?  
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors  
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur  
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt  
On a late night coming home from way too many train rides  
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time  
Highbury Estate's fine, smoking like a dragon but don't chase lines  
  
Hey, I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
And now I'm sitting on a night bus flicking through my iPod  
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up, driver turn the lights  
Off  
Lights on, on stage, mics on, song plays, nice one  
Gotta keep my hype strong, truth be, never went to Uni  
People see right through me but I'm not a fool, see  
I'm never gonna do one, gonna live past 22,  
Done everything I need to, except get a 2:1  
  
I haven't slept for the past week  
And two hours ain't enough for me  
I feel inspired, at quarter to three A.M.  
I haven't changed since our last meet  
I'm still getting all my meals for free  
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again  
  
'Cause it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah  
  
When I feel cold, you keep me warm  
And I'm not looking for some loose change  
Just wanna find a true mate  
Who wants to be my duvet, hey  
  
It's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
And it's not a homeless life for me  
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be  
  
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah

 

[Verse 1]  
When the sins of my father  
Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down, lord  
Make it rain  
Oh, make it rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
Well, a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound  
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye  
But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain  
Even so, and just the same  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Verse 3]  
The seas are full of water  
Stops by the shore  
It's like the riches of grandeur  
Never reach the poor  
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause  
And let lightning be the veins  
And fill the sky with all that they can draw  
When it's time to make a change  
  
[Chorus x4]

 

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well  
And I could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
Sometimes I wonder  
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover  
To me listening to Stevie Wonder  
Under the covers where we used to lay  
And re-stacks is what the speakers play  
I'll be on tour almost every day  
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay  
Just watching the dvd, smoking illegal weed  
Getting high as two kites, and we needed to breathe  
We used each other's air just for the people to see  
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us  
And also you are beautiful without your make-up  
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause  
We can all be loved the way God made us  
And time's the only reason that we could break up  
Cause you would always tell me away too much  
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane  
Or make a mistake, say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
And every weekend in the winter  
You'd be wearing my hoodie  
With draw strings pulled tight  
To keep your face in the cold  
Taking day trips to the local  
Where we eat on the road  
Cause every day when I was away  
We'd only speak on the phone  
Watching Blue Planet  
Creating new habits  
And if we were two rabbits  
And then you vanish  
Back to 'burgh with all the Celtics, i'd dissapear  
You call me selfish, I understand  
But I can't help it  
I put my job before everything  
Except my family and friends  
But you'll be in between forever  
So I guess we'll have to take a step back  
Overlook the situation  
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications  
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break  
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late  
So we can either deal with the pain  
Or wait to get on a plane  
But in the day we'll have to say it again  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Love will come and love will go  
But you can make it on your own  
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now  
People grow, and fall apart  
But you can mend your broken heart  
Take it back, oh won't you leave me now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
And then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now  
  
Oh Nina, you should go Nina  
'Cause I ain't never coming home  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
And I've been living on the road Nina  
Then again you should know Nina  
Cause that's you and me both  
Nina oh, won't you leave me now  
Now

 

[Intro]  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
[Verse 1]  
Waking up, midnight November  
And just still in my bed  
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya  
There's things we've never said  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So if I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
  
[Verse 2]  
It's not enough, to say I want ya  
Cause I'll say anything  
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt  
I had have just been questioning it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
If I go for a little while longer  
When I'm home we can talk about the big falls of the road  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the role now  
And act like it's never been broke  
  
[Chorus]  
Though my soul, oh oh oh  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, oh oh oh  
How long, how long, can we be  
  
[Bridge]  
All of my bones, they scream I'm right  
If you're taking me home to stay the night  
Darling my soul would heal  
  
[Outro]  
If you say go, I would stop everything oh  
My heart would play the wrong  
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul  
Lately I really need to know  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
Oh my soul, how long  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go  
How long, how long, can we be touch and go

 

I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
(Hey-ey-ey yeah...)  
  
And I know dark clouds, will gather me  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me  
  
And I know my way, is rough and steep  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now  
  
Cause I am a poor, wayfaring Stranger  
Traveling through this world alone  
There's no sickness, toil or danger  
In that bright land, to which I go  
I'm going there to see my mother  
And I'm going there no more to roam  
I'm only going over Jordan  
I'm only going over home now

 

Treat me beneath this clear night sky  
And I will lie with you  
I start to feel those butterflies  
When I'm next to you  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
It's been this way since we were young  
We'll fight and then make up  
I'll breathe your air into my lungs  
When I feel your touch  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
Da da da da  
  
Tell me your secrets  
Give me a friend  
Let all the good times flood in  
  
Do I love you? Do I hate you?  
I can't make up my mind  
So let's free fall  
And see where we land

 

White lips, pale face  
Breathing in snowflakes  
Burnt lungs, sour taste  
  
Lights gone, days end  
Struggling to pay rent  
Long nights, strange men  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, for angels to fly  
  
Ripped gloves, raincoat  
Tried to swim and stay afloat  
Dry house, wet clothes  
  
Loose change, bank notes  
Weary-eyed, dry throat  
Call girl, no phone  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
And they scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
'Cause we're just under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
But she don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in a pipe she flies to the motherland  
Or sells love to another man  
Its too cold outside  
For angels to fly  
An angel will die  
Covered in white  
Closed eye  
And hoping for a better life  
This time, we'll fade out tonight  
Straight down the line  
  
And they say  
She's in the class A team  
Stuck in her daydream  
Been this way since eighteen  
But lately her face seems  
Slowly sinking, wasting  
Crumbling like pastries  
  
They scream  
The worst things in life come free to us  
And we're under the upper hand  
And go mad for a couple grams  
And we don't want to go outside, tonight  
And in the pipe fly to the motherland  
Or sell love to another man  
It's too cold outside  
For angels to fly, angels to fly  
To fly, fly  
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly  
Angels to die

 

Things were all good yesterday  
And then the devil took your memory  
And if you fell to your death today  
I hope that heaven is your resting place  
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain  
But then that could have been the medicine  
And now you're lying in the bed again  
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And things were all good yesterday  
Then the devil took your breath away  
And now we're left here in the pain  
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain  
And now my family is one again  
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend  
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen  
Six years old I remember when  
  
And my father told me, son  
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face  
And you're not the only one  
Although my grandma used to say, he used to sing  
  
Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night  
And we'll lie inside, a little while here, oh  
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up  
And we're wrapped in light, in life, in love  
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut  
For they're designed to be together oh  
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one  
And we're set alight, we're afire love, love, love oh  
  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
And my mother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah  
And my brother and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
(And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah)  
And my father and all of my family  
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah

 

[ 'It\'s just another night, and I\'m staring at the moon  
I saw a shooting star and thought of you  
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  
If you were here, I\'d sing to you  
You\'re on the other side, as this skyline splits in two  
Miles away from seeing you  
  
But I can see the stars from America  
I wondered do you see them too?  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
I can hear your heart on the radio beats  
They\'re playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us  
Back to the time you were lying next to me  
I looked across and fell in love  
So I took your hand back through London streets and knew  
Everything led back to you  
  
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?  
Hear the song our heart is beating to?  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
And all  
And all  
And all  
I can see the stars from America

'] 

Another day another life  
Passes by just like mine  
It's not complicated  
  
Another mind  
Another soul  
Another body to grow old  
It's not complicated  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Another tear  
Another cry  
Another place for us to die  
It's not complicated  
  
Another love that's gone to waste  
Another light lost from your face  
It's complicated  
  
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Ooh how I miss you  
My symphony played the song that carried you out  
Ooh how I miss you  
And I, I miss you and I wish you'd stay  
  
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?  
Float down  
Like autumn leaves  
Hush now  
Close your eyes before the sleep  
And you're miles away  
And yesterday you were here with me  
  
Touch down  
Like a seven four seven  
Or stay out and we'll live forever now

 

Unhappy days that left us on the floor  
And you breathe me 'til you're not feeling sure  
Everything will brighten up  
If we go to Brighton, I'll take you along the pier  
Everything will lighten up  
If you feel too frightened, I'll make it disappear, dear  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And sunny days that left my skin bright red  
And you squeeze me 'til these thoughts leave my head  
If it gets too complicated,  
I'll keep up and be frustrated, can you see what's wrong?  
If you feel like you've been hated,  
This love's too overrated, see what's going on, on  
  
And darling, don't be nervous  
I'll understand if you'll let me go  
I did this on purpose now  
  
And when I'm missing you, I'll stop eating food  
And I'll squeeze into a dress so I can be like you  
And then I'll see your bitterness and why you're leaving too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
Take me back to live at home  
And take me back to Albert Road  
  
Now I'm missing you, I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I can feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
I thought I'd put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
I think that I love you  
  
And I've stopped eating food  
And I've squeezed into your dress so I could feel like you  
But then I saw your bitterness and why you left me too  
Maybe I'll put you to a test and say that 'I love you'  
Now it seems you loved me too

I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen music that we play, somehow gets glued to your brain  
I'm the future when I'm in the boost I'm like I'm living in 3008  
This music gave me a lane to ride in,  
But there aint' cars in the sky yet, so hold tight  
Because I'm in flight like a plane with a of a lion  
You know why? Because I got pole bars hard like crowbars  
You can't gamble with no cards  
What d'you wanna call it then you get stung like a phone charge  
Music mentally uses me like a sailor might use sonar  
To find where the flows are, upon an ocean floor that's so dark  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
My heart falls heavy, like a bankers belly  
But when I'm writing songs,  
I'm happy like chunk when you got away from the Portellies  
And there's a musical vibe that usually moves inside of my mind  
Therefore I've got a fortune already, and I ain't even talking in pennies  
So ride on, my faith is blind like a man who requires a guide dog  
And life's wrong, but I stride on regardless of anything I am strong  
I got all that I need in a mic and a beat to see how alive I can be  
  
And I got sweet sensation inside of me, because my mind's ease  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
I...  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation  
  
Listen, I wanna say rest in peace, for children murdered on you. K. Streets  
When a country wages a war there's a war going on in our very own streets  
And I say that life's too short, to end up in the move of a cool  
So why not give music a fall and use it to dive like a hawk  
Listen, we all get down in the dumps  
But when they hear the melody and base line pump  
I feel my heart rate jump through the roof and then  
I run loose on my tongue  
Confer with Morpheus if you need proof I'm the one  
Or I'll put my heart on the scales to prove that my  
Cardiac muscle weighs more than a ton  
  
Sweet sensation  
The music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
Sweet sensation  
Listen, listen, the music that we play  
Will ease your mind  
  
I am a man with a heavy heart,  
And I dare not tear the pages  
Fighting with automatic self destruction  
It's a blind faith  
A cruel waste  
One bitter taste  
So I know why I can't fight this sweet sensation.

 

[Verse 1]  
I've been spinning now for time  
Couple women by my side  
I got sinning on my mind  
Sipping on red wine  
I've been sitting here for ages  
Ripping out the pages  
How'd I get so faded?  
How'd I get so faded?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've been looking for a lover  
Thought I'd find her in a bottle  
God, make me another one  
I'll be feeling this tomorrow  
Lord forgive me for the things I've done  
I was never meant to hurt no one  
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh no no don't leave me lonely now  
If you loved me how'd you never learn  
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes  
One or two could free my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
This is how it ends, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
Fading out again, I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream  
So tell me when it kicks in  
So tell me when it kicks in  
  
[Bridge x5]  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
All the voices in my mind  
Calling out across the line  
  
[Outro x6]  
Tell me when it kicks in  
I saw scars upon her  
Tell me when it kicks in  
Broken hearted

 

[ 'Goodbye Norma Jean  
Though I never knew you at all  
You had the grace to hold yourself  
While those around you crawled  
They crawled out of the woodwork  
And they whispered into your brain  
They set you on the treadmill  
And they made you change your name  
  
And it seems to me you lived your life  
Like a candle in the wind  
Never knowing who to cling to  
When the rain set in  
And I would have liked to have known you  
But I was just a kid  
Your candle burned out long before  
Your legend ever did  
  
Loneliness was tough  
The toughest role you ever played  
Hollywood created a superstar  
And pain was the price you paid  
Even when you died  
Oh the press still hounded you  
All the papers had to say  
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  
  
Goodbye Norma Jean  
From the young man in the 22nd row  
Who sees you as something as more than sexual  
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

'] 

She's like cold coffee in the morning  
I'm drunk off last nights whisky and coke  
She'll make me shiver without warning  
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke  
  
And you can stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
I'll wake with coffee in the morning  
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea  
Outside the day is up and calling  
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep  
  
Stay with me forever  
Or you could stay with me for now  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
'Cause I love the way you wake me up  
For goodness sake will my love not be enough?  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight  
Tell me if I know  
Tell me if I do  
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to  
  
Tell me if I'm wrong  
Tell me if I'm right  
Tell me if you need a loving hand  
To help you fall asleep tonight

 

Ah lahmlahlah  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I met this girl late last year  
She said don't you worry if I disappear  
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake  
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait  
But then I jump right in  
A week later returned  
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn  
But I gave her my time for two or three nights  
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right  
I went away for months until our paths crossed again  
She told me I was never looking for a friend  
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10  
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin  
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late am  
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said  
She's singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 2:]  
For a couple weeks I  
Only want to see her  
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza  
Before a text message was the only way to reach her  
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her  
Singing out Aretha  
All over the track like a feature  
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either  
But me and her we make money the same way  
Four cities, two planes the same day  
Those shows have never been what it's about  
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out  
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch  
But we should get on a plane  
Or we'll be missing it now  
Wish I'd have written it down  
The way that things played out  
When she was kissing him  
How? I was confused about  
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Verse 3:]  
[Knock knock] on my hotel door  
I don't even know if she knows what for  
She was crying on my shoulder  
I already told ya  
Trust and respect is what we do this for  
I never intended to be next  
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all  
And I never saw him as a threat  
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course  
It's not like we were both on tour  
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor  
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment  
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different  
This is not the way you realize what you wanted  
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest  
All this time God knows I'm singing  
Ah lahmlahlah  
  
[Chorus 2x:]  
Don't fuck with my love  
That heart is so cold  
All over my home  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah  
Don't fuck with my love  
I told her she knows  
Take aim and reload  
I don't wanna know that babe  
Ah lahmlahlah

 

I wanna be drunk when I wake up  
On the right side of the wrong bed  
And never in a excuse I made up  
Tell you the truth I hate  
What didn't kill me  
It never made me stronger at all.  
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me  
So now I'll maybe leave back there  
I'm sat here wishing I was sober  
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.  
  
But the house gets cold when you cut the heating  
Without you to hold I'll be freezing  
Can't rely on my heart to beating  
'Cause you take part of it every evening  
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing  
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love  
  
I wanna hold your heart in both hands  
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can  
And I've got no plans for the weekend  
So shall we speak then  
Keep it between friends  
No, I know you'll never love me like you used to.  
  
But may be other people like us  
Who see the flicker of the clip when they light up  
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before  
You don't hold me anymore.  
  
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name  
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake  
You know I can't change as I began saying  
You cut me wide open like landscape  
Open bottles of beer but never champagne  
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make.  
  
Should I, should I?  
And maybe I'll get drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.  
  
All by myself  
I'm here again  
All by myself  
You know I'll never change  
All by myself  
All by myself  
I'm just drunk, again  
I'll be drunk again  
I'll be drunk again  
To feel a little love.

 

[ '[Taylor Swift]  
I use to think that love was for dreamers,  
"Love at first sight" I never believed it,  
Had my head on tight, I lived in the real world,  
But that was until I met you.  
Now everything is changed.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Yesterday I was drinking my sorrows away,  
On the edge of forever storing my heart away,  
On the verge of letting my heart go stray.  
And that\'s when I met you.  
And now everything is changed.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Oh darling,  
You look like your soul is lost.  
What could\'ve happened to make you feel so low?  
Don\'t let the liquor ease your hurt.  
Don\'t let your heart go cold.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
Oh darling,  
Don\'t worry, I\'ll be just fine.  
What\'s a pretty girl like you doing in a place like this?  
If I weren\'t drinking then I\'d be crying,  
And I think that\'s something we both rather miss.  
  
[Both]  
But I guess that\'s just how the cookie crumbles,  
You give your all and watch as your heart tumbles  
Down and down until you can\'t feel anymore.  
  
[Ed Sheeran]  
That\'s the thing about love,  
That\'s the reason why I\'ll never fall again,  
It hurts when it\'s supposed to make you make you feel good.  
  
[Taylor Swift]  
Well if that\'s what love is,  
Then I don\'t ever wanna try it out,  
But something tells me I should.  
  
Even though we\'ve only met each other,  
We\'ll work it out together until everything is changed.  
Until everything is good.

Faces change  
But this place'll stay the same  
And I'll know  
When I'll go  
  
Yeah  
And I'm pickin' up another bag  
And I pack another knapsack  
The airport's like a stop light to me  
Sittin' on red, green light go  
Can't see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans, some may call 'em  
And it's on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy, no wakin' up to stop the dream  
I lived the life, signed a picture  
'Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates, I'm in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block, they judge you on 'em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack, and a shotgun just for show?  
I'll put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
I'm the  
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism, but at least the critic's write  
With a broken pen, there they go again  
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' jam  
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in  
I'm goin' home, I'm home again  
Bring it back up in the UK  
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy, hell, you say  
I'm just bein' blunt, homie  
Keep the grass  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah, take one look  
Better yet, take two  
But if I take that break, there's a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots I've been  
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season  
'Cause I am not the reason  
That the image you're used to seein'  
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes, I'm different  
Differently made  
And me screamin' the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
It's the place I stayed  
'Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught, but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne, it was in my name  
Michael  
M.W.A  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin' out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven  
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood line's not a family tree  
It's a needle in my skin for all to see  
I ain't never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams don't lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly

 

The rain won't stop falling,  
It's harder than before  
This car keeps on stalling,  
Pedal to the floor  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know is if you want me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We were young and we were foolish  
Schoolbooks in our arms  
Dodging homework, dodging classes  
To set off fire alarms  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call  
  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
We are waving our lives away  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
  
And what I need to know is if you love me, and I  
Really need to know if you need me when you call  
If you want me when you call

 

I fell in love next to you  
Burning fires in this room  
It just fits, light and smooth  
Like my feet in my shoes  
Little one, lie with me  
Sew you heart to my sleeve  
We'll stay quiet underneath  
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
Teach my skin those new tricks  
Warm me up with your lips  
Heart to heart, melt me down  
It's too cold in this town  
Close your eyes, lean on me  
Face to mouth, lips to cheek  
Feeling numb in my feet  
You're the one  
To help me get to sleep  
  
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
It's only been one night of love  
And maybe that is not enough  
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe  
Feeling like you won't believe  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes  
  
There's a firefly loose tonight  
Better catch it before it burns this place down  
And I lie if I don't feel so right  
But the world looks better through your eyes

 

Give me love like her,  
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,  
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,  
Told you I'd let them go,  
And that I'll fight my corner,  
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,  
After my blood turns into alcohol,  
No, I just wanna hold ya.  
  
Give a little time to me or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love.  
  
Give me love like never before,  
'Cause lately I've been craving more,  
And it's been a while but I still feel the same,  
Maybe I should let you go,  
You know I'll fight my corner,  
And that tonight I'll call ya,  
After my blood is drowning in alcohol,  
No I just wanna hold ya.  
  
Give a little time to me or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
Give a little time to me, or burn this out,  
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,  
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My my, my, my, oh give me love.  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover.  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me).  
  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love, love me),  
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love).  
  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,  
My, my, my, my, oh give me love  
  
Of all the money that e'er I had  
I've spent it in good company  
And all the harm that e'er I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of width  
To memory now I can't recall  
So fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
Of all the comrades that ever I had  
They are sorry for my going away  
And all the sweethearts that ever I had  
They would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all

 

Smoke alarm went off at night  
I woke up wiped the sleep out of my eye  
She left a note, I'll be back in five  
Well I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive  
  
Hey!  
  
I was told to put my job in front of you,  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love,  
Waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge  
Smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved  
  
I never told her that I liked  
The way she dances slightly out of time  
And pretends she knows the words, to a song she's never heard  
But I tell her all the time  
  
Hey!  
  
Well I was told to put my job in front of you  
But it won't hold me like you do  
  
But I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
But maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved, hey  
  
I do it for the love, waiting on the gold rush  
Keep it on the edge, smoking on a roll up  
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up  
And remember the time  
When we were in school, listening to grown ups  
Didn't learn a thing, but then again you know what  
You know how to sing  
But you don't know anything other than that  
  
So maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
And maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
But maybe you should learn to love her like, like the way  
You wanna be loved

 

My mind is a warrior,  
My heart is a foreigner,  
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset,  
I'll never keep it bottled up,  
Left to the hands of the coroner,  
Be a true heart not a follower,  
We're not done yet now,  
I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we can ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
Now keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down.  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down,  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
My eyes are a river filler,  
This drink is a liver killer,  
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
  
And your mind is my new best friend,  
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again,  
Now I see it in your movements tonight,  
If we should ever do this right,  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
Oh I'll never let you down,  
We'll keep it on the down low  
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,  
That I'll never let you down,  
I'll never let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now,  
And I'll never let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
You're strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way,  
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down

 

Oh, misty eye of the mountain dewlow  
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls  
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke  
Keep watching over Durin's son  
  
If this is to end in fire  
Then we should all burn together  
Watch the flames climb high into the night  
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
And if we should die tonight  
Then we should all die together  
Raise a glass of wine for the last time  
Calling out father, oh  
Prepare as we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn over  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see fire  
Inside the mountain  
I see fire  
Burning the trees  
And I see fire  
Hollowing souls  
I see fire  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
Oh, should my people fall in  
Surely I'll do the same  
Confined in mountain halls  
We got too close to the flame  
Calling out father  
Hold fast and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
And if the babies are burning  
I will get myself a fork  
For if the dark returns then  
My brothers will come for dinner  
And as the sky is falling down  
It crashed into this party town  
And with that shadow upon the ground  
I hear my people screaming out  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
  
I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning) (fire)  
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin, yeah) (fire)  
And I see fire (Uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire)  
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

 

Tempo sees Ed not feeling his best.  
  
Ooh I'm a mess right now  
Inside out  
Searching for a sweet surrender  
But this is not the end  
I can't work it out  
How going through the motions  
Going through us  
And oh I've known it for the longest time  
And all my hope  
All my words are all over written on the signs  
But you're on my road walking me home  
Home, home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
And put your faith in my stomach  
  
I messed up this time  
Late last night  
Drinking to suppress devotion  
With fingers intertwined  
I can't shake this feeling now  
We're going through the motions  
Hoping you'd stop  
  
And oh I've only caused you pain  
You know but all of my words will always below  
Of all the love you spoke  
When you're on my road walking me home  
Home, home, home  
  
See the flames inside my eyes  
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love  
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar  
But for tonight I wanna fall in love  
Put your faith in my stomach  
  
And for how long I love my lover  
For how long I love my lover  
And now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Now now, for how long, long I love my lover  
(I feel love)  
For how long, long I love my lover  
For how long, long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long, long I love my lover  
Now, now, for how long, long I love my lover  
Feel it all over now  
For how long I love my lover  
Now now  
For how long, long I love my lover

 

Settle down with me  
Cover me up  
Cuddle me in  
  
Lie down with me  
And hold me in your arms  
  
And your heart's against my chest, your lips pressed in my neck  
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet  
And I'm feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now  
  
Kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love  
Falling in love  
  
Settle down with me  
And I'll be your safety  
You'll be my lady  
  
I was made to keep your body warm  
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms  
  
Oh no  
My heart's against your chest, your lips pressed in my neck  
I'm falling for your eyes, but they don't know me yet  
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now  
  
Kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
I'm falling in love  
Falling in love  
  
Yeah I've been feeling everything  
From hate to love  
From love to lust  
From lust to truth  
I guess that's how I know you  
So I hold you close to help you give it up  
  
So kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love  
Falling in love  
  
Kiss me like you wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
You wanna be loved  
This feels like falling in love  
Falling in love

 

I'm gonna pick up the pieces  
And build a Lego house  
When things go wrong we can knock it down  
  
My three words have two meanings  
There's one thing on my mind, it's all for you  
  
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm gonna paint you by numbers and color you in  
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall  
  
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before  
And I'll surrender up my heart and swap it for yours  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind, I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
Don't hold me down,  
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take  
  
And if it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm  
And if you're broken I'll mend ya  
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind  
I'll do it all for you in time  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now  
  
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love  
I'll pick you up when you're getting down  
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

 

You give me life like lots of oxygen  
You treat me like I was in love again  
And I'd hold you tight, tight enough to know  
That you were mine, I'd never let you go  
  
And it's you I miss  
And it's you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out, now  
And let it out  
And let it out now, now  
  
And you speak to me behind your dark green stare  
And you'd let me be as if I wasn't there  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex,  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue  
  
It's you I miss  
And it's you I miss  
So let it out  
And let it out, now  
And let it out  
And let it out, now, now.  
  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn part, you see we were just like glue  
  
We're like glue  
  
So let it out  
Let it out, now  
Let it out  
And let it out, now, now  
  
It seemed perfect, the concept, free from any regret  
Another couple based on teen sex  
You idiot, true I was just like you  
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

 

If we take this bird in, with it's broken leg,  
We can nurse it, she said,  
Come inside for a little lie down with me,  
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worse thing.  
  
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder,  
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?  
And let me hold you, oh.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew,  
We can lie down, so I'm next to you,  
Come inside for a little home made tea,  
And if you fall asleep, at least you're next to me,  
And if I wake up, say it's late love, go back to sleep,  
I'm covered by nature, and I'm safe now,  
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
My little bird.  
  
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love,  
You make me scream, then I made you cry,  
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die.  
  
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth,  
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do,  
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet,  
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon,  
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird,  
My little bird, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa,  
My little bird,  
My little bird,  
You're my little bird.

 

There wasn't much left  
Except for the last twenty sack  
And the last twenty of my last check  
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step  
Woke up and took it in with a half breath  
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick  
I lit my cigarette  
Feeling half dead, whiskey on my mind  
Then came the dead  
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest  
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by  
My girl cried baby this'll be my last bye  
Baby in her arms  
She took a cab home  
She told me I was only good for a sad song  
A crooked smile I gave  
Nonchalant about it  
Maybe she'll come back  
This time I doubt it  
Act like I care, but I really don't  
Wanted to change  
But somehow I knew I really won't  
See I'm the type of man, who can't stay out the bottle  
If the sun is out I'd rather be in the shadow  
Sadness is like a wound that I can't heal  
Maybe I'll love blood, I just let it spill  
And I never turned to church for a pray in hand  
God's not going to land another saving hand  
If the time came like it has time again  
Then I would watch the clock and be late again  
One gun and a Harley in the driveway  
One way out, dirt road, pathway  
Put another dead butt in the ash tray  
I stand up still drunk, half baked  
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring  
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring  
Paid him no attention  
In fact I barely seen him  
Until he walked away  
And he started singing  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I didn't see it coming  
I didn't see the wall  
And I went from running, to a slow crawl  
I feel like I'm a child, but I'm afraid to cry  
Would say I'm okay but I'm afraid to lie  
I speak no evil, but hear no angels  
A family is callin' but all I see is strangers  
Take the bible from the hotel drawer  
Hell froze over ice cold hell's door  
Knock knock  
I'm on the salt road non stop  
The exit I will pass 'cause the sign did rot  
And the gust of a dry summer  
Dirty water in the tap  
I think I found my number in the sand  
Right next to an empty can  
Old number seven, Jack is back again  
And the voice goes round and round  
And I would take the bridge  
But I can't forget the sound  
  
London Bridge is falling down, falling down  
And if it don't stop falling, then all of us will drown  
Then we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
And we'll crash, crash, right down again  
Oh we'll crash, crash, right down again  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down  
Rolling like a rock 'til I hit the ground  
Running from the law but I can't be found  
Only my God can track me down  
  
I'll be coming up when the sun goes down

 

Shock horror,  
I'm down,  
Lost your not around,  
There's a lump in my chest that,  
Sends cold through my head and,  
My mind shuts sound out,  
I'm on auto pilot,  
And my tongue's gone silent,  
  
Just switch it off and lay it down,  
Lay it down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
And I miss you,  
  
These words mean nothing to me,  
I'm just sitting on a fence of  
How it used to be,  
These three words,  
Are aching,  
Constrict them, Suffocating  
My mind is racing with the picture I'm painting,  
And my belly's sick to it's stomach,  
When I remember all the times he was with you when you,  
  
Layed it down,  
You lay down,  
Next to me,  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
  
More than I let on,  
And I kissed you,  
For far too long,  
I'll let go,  
As soon as you do,  
But I know,  
That we're not through  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you,  
That I miss you,  
(Woahhh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe when I made you mine, (Whoaahh)  
I don't know when I lost my mind,  
Maybe it was every time,  
You said, You said, You said,  
That I miss you.

 

If you were here beside me,  
Instead of in New York  
If the curve of you was curved on me  
  
I'd tell you that I loved you  
Before I even knew you  
'Cause I loved the simple thought of you  
  
If our hearts had never broken  
Well there's no joy in the mending  
So much this hurt can teach us both  
  
There's distance and there's silence  
Your words have never left me  
They're the prayer that I say every day  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the heat of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
If you were here beside me  
Instead of New York  
In the arms you said you'd never leave  
  
I'd tell you that it's simple  
And it was only ever thus  
There is nowhere else that I belong  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
Come on come out come here come here  
  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to spark  
I miss it all from the love to the lightning  
And the lack of it snaps me in two  
  
Just give me a sign  
There is end in a beginning  
Til the quiet chaos driving me mad  
The lone neon lights  
And the want of the ocean  
And the fire that had started to go out

 

[Verse:]  
Tell me that you turned down the man  
Who asked for your hand  
Cause you're waiting for me  
And I know, you're gonna be away a while  
But I've got no plans at all to leave  
And would you take away my hopes and dreams  
And just stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Take my hand and my  
Heart and soul, I will  
Only have these eyes for you  
And you know, everything changes but  
We'll be strangers if, we see this through  
You could stay within these walls and bleed  
Or just stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend  
Cause you are the only one  
  
[Bridge:]  
I'm stumbling out drunk, getting myself lost  
I am so gone, so tell me the way home  
I listen to sad songs, singing about love  
And where it goes wrong?  
  
[Chorus:]  
All my senses come to life  
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I  
Have ever been and I'll never leave again  
Cause you are the only one  
And all my friends have gone to find  
Another place to let their hearts collide  
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend  
Cause you are the only one

And all the harm that e'er I've done  
Alas it was to none but me  
And all I've done for want of wit

Of all the comrades that e'er I had

And all the sweethearts that e'er I had  
They would wish me one more day to stay  
But since it falls unto my lot  
That I should rise and you should not  
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call  
Good night and joy be with you all  
  
A man may drink and not be drunk  
A man may fight and not be slain  
A man may court a pretty girl  
And perhaps be welcomed back again  
But since it has so ought to be  
By a time to rise and a time to fall  
Come fill to me the parting glass  
Good night and joy be with you all  
Good night and joy be with you all

 

[Verse 1]  
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes.  
But it's the only thing that I know.  
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes,  
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts are never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul,  
And it's the only thing that I know, know.  
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of 'ya,  
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We keep this love in a photograph.  
We made these memories for ourselves.  
Where our eyes are never closing,  
Our hearts were never broken,  
And time's forever frozen, still.  
  
[Chorus]  
So you can keep me  
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans.  
Holding me close until our eyes meet.  
You won't ever be alone,  
And if you hurt me,  
That's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home,  
Wait for me to come home.  
  
[Bridge]  
You can fit me  
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen.  
Next to your heartbeat where I should be.  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
And if you hurt me  
Well that's okay baby, only words bleed.  
Inside these pages you just hold me,  
And I won't ever let you go.  
  
[Outro]  
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me  
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street,  
Hearing you whisper through the phone,  
Wait for me to come home.

I've known it for a long time  
Daddy wakes up to a drink at night  
Disappearing all night  
I don't wanna know where he's been lying  
I know what I wanna do  
I wanna runaway runaway with you  
Gonna grab clothes, socks, in the morning, go  
How long are you leaving?  
Well dad just don't expect me back  
This evening  
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this  
It's been a long day almost out of the roadway  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in this home  
There's nothing to say cuz he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own  
  
I've never seen my dad cry  
Cold as stone, in the kitchen light  
I tell you it's about time  
But I was raised to keep quiet  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move  
Gonna grab clothes, and when it's morning, go  
  
How long are you leaving?  
Well dad just don't expect me back, this evening  
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this  
It's been a long day  
Almost out of the roadway  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in this home  
There's nothing to say cuz he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own  
  
Back pack, and a flat cap  
Turned to the back  
Cause I packed my clothes up  
My dad wasn't in without that plan to attack and turns his shoulder  
I don't wanna live this way  
Gonna take my things and go  
If things change in a matter of days  
Could be persuaded to hold up  
And mama was the same  
None of us are saints  
To get the god knows that  
I don't wanna runaway  
And one of these days I might just show that  
Put my home in a suitcase  
tie both shoelaces, and hope that  
Things change, but for now  
I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder  
  
But I love him from the skin to my bones  
But I don't wanna live in home  
There's nothing to say and he knows  
I'll just runaway and be on my own

 

I paid all my dues  
And she wanted to know  
That I'd never leave her  
Now I'm ready to go  
And strange as it seems  
She's endless to me  
She's just like paperwork  
But harder to read  
  
Patience, my enemy  
And loving's my friend  
It's harder to leave  
With my heart on my sleeve  
Than to stay and just pretend  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
  
I made all my plans  
And she has made hers  
She kept me in mind  
But I wasn't sure  
I searched every room  
For a way to escape  
But every time  
I tried to leave  
She keeps holding on to me  
For dear life  
And blocking my way  
  
Patience, my enemy  
And loving's my friend  
It's harder to leave  
With my heart on my sleeve  
Than to stay and just pretend  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
  
And like the back of her hand  
She already understands everything  
Won't you stay?  
She says  
And she already knows how it goes  
And where she stands  
I'll stay, anyway  
Cos she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself  
Oh, she knows me so well  
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

 

I can taste salt water  
And if I blink again  
You'll be sinking in  
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made  
I'll hold ya and you'll think of him  
And pretty soon you'll be floating away  
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat, love  
And I'm captain of this sinking boat, now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes  
  
I still taste salt water  
On my lips from your kiss, bitterness  
And I'll drown within the oceans you made  
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make up  
I'll never trust you again  
You can just be a friend  
And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of  
Anchored down in the throat, love  
And I'm captain of this sinking boat now  
With just one armband to carry me home  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeve  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth  
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild  
Tonight, the fact is I  
I'm on my way home  
I'm on my way home  
I lied, I tried to cry but I'm, I'm drowning in the oceans you made  
  
When salted tears won't dry  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
These hearts will be flooded tonight  
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves  
Under your eyes  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes

 

It's late in the evening  
Glass on the side now  
I've been sat with you  
For most of the night  
Ignoring everybody here  
We wish they would disappear  
So maybe we could get down now  
And I don't wanna know  
If you're getting ahead of the program  
I want you to be mine, lady  
To hold your body close  
Take another step into the no-man's land  
For the longest time lady  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe  
  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
  
This love is a blaze  
I saw flames from the side of the stage  
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days  
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know  
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke  
Let it go until I wrote a change  
Singing we found love in a local rage no  
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say  
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray  
I told them my name and said it's nice to meet ya  
And then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila  
I already know she's a keeper  
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in deep  
If anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home  
But I'm drunk and gonna live it now not?  
We just sit on the couch one thing  
Led to another now she's kissing my mouth  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe  
  
Sing!  
Louder!  
Sing!  
  
Can you feel it?  
All the guys in here don't really wanna dance  
Can you feel it?  
All that I can here is music from the back  
Can you feel it?  
Found you hiding here so hoped you taked my hand  
  
Before the beats kicks in again  
Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it?  
  
I need you darling  
Come on set the tone  
If you feel you're falling  
Won't you let me know  
If you love me come on get involved  
Feeling rushing through you from your head to toe

 

You're not her, though I try to see you differently  
I tow the line  
You see I'm searching for what used to be mine  
I saw your eyes  
And then I saw her staring back at me  
And I will try to find another one  
Who suited me as well as her  
  
I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
She was mine  
I was hers and all that's in between  
If she would cry,  
I would shelter her  
And keep her from the darkness that will be  
  
If I moved far away from you  
And I want to see you here  
Beside me, dear  
But things aren't clear  
When we never even tried  
We never even talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might find  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
Don't drop me in it's not my time  
If you cut deep then I might learn  
That you scarred and left me like a sunburn  
  
We never even tried  
We never talked  
We never even thought in the long run  
Whenever it was painful  
Whenever I was away  
I'd miss you, and I miss you.

 

This city never sleeps  
I hear the people walk by when it's late  
Sirens bleed through my windowsill  
I can't close my eyes  
Can't control what I'm into  
This tower is alive  
The lights that blind keep me awake  
With my hood up and lace untied  
Sleep fills my mind  
Can't control what I'm into  
  
London calls me a stranger  
A traveler  
This is now my home, my home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two  
  
The pavement is my friend  
And it will take me where I need to go  
I find it trips me up  
And puts me down  
This is not what I'm used to  
The shop across the road  
Fulfills my needs and gives me company  
When I need it  
Voices speak through my walls  
I don't think I'm gonna make it  
Past tomorrow  
  
London calls me a stranger  
A traveler  
This is now my home, my home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two  
  
And my lungs hurt  
And my ears bled  
With the sound of the city life  
Echoed in my head  
Do I need this to keep me alive?  
The traffic stops and starts  
But I need to move along  
  
London calls me a stranger  
This is not my home, home  
I'm burning on the back street  
Stuck here sitting in the backseat  
I'm blazing on the street  
What I do isn't up to you  
And if the city never sleeps  
Then that makes two

 

I keep my hopes and dreams inside of you amongst the other things my mother
seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering,  
Never been known by my government name, my foster home is where I've been
placed away from the pain,  
So as you sit before me with a folder holding my story, you're my savior with
nothing on me but power and glory,  
And surely you'll never ignore cos when the the court came the court date was
made to disappear for me,  
You think you understand me but never what I went through but you were never
meant to I won't hold it against you,  
I take a ballpoint pen to play dot to dot with the cigarette burns etched in
my forearms,  
Forget me not never let me stop you'll just sit and watch it's your job to be
patient so you'll let me off,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side, see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,  
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away,  
Okay sessions over time to get back to the classroom I hate this lesson and I
guess the teacher finds it hard to,  
You told me I should try my best but guess what I still find this trigonometry
a head fuck,  
Constantly told I won't pass my gcse's,  
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese,  
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it,  
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em,  
Lately classmates think I'm crazy turn up daily resembling bill bailey,  
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it without new clothes or
shower it hard to do,  
So after school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes but they'll get
taken off me when I get back to the group home,  
So come with me take a walk on the wild side see life in a day through a
child's eyes,  
And these dreams are all I have, to hold me,  
When sleeps the only thing that I want to take me away, away.

 

[Verse 1]  
When your legs don't work like they used to before  
And I can't sweep you off of your feet  
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?  
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?  
And darling I will be loving you 'till we're 70  
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23  
And I'm thinking 'bout how  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe just a touch of a hand  
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day  
And I just wanna tell you I am  
  
[Chorus]  
So honey, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are  
  
[Verse 2]  
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades  
And the crowds don't remember my name  
When my hands don't play the strings the same way  
Mmm, I know you will still love me the same  
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen  
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory  
And I'm thinking about how  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
People fall in love in mysterious ways  
Maybe it's all part of a plan  
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes  
Hoping that you'll understand  
  
[Chorus]  
But baby, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
And maybe we found love right where we are oh oh..  
  
La la la la la la....  
  
[Chorus]  
So baby, now  
Take me into your loving arms  
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars  
Oh darling  
Place your head on my beating heart  
I'm thinking out loud  
That maybe we found love right where we are  
And baby we found love right where we are  
And we found love right where we are

 

This is the start of something beautiful  
This is the start of something new  
You are the one who'd make me lose it all  
You are the start of something new, ooh  
  
And I'll throw it all away  
And watch you fall into my arms again  
And I'll throw it all away  
Watch you fall, now  
  
You are the earth that I will stand upon  
You are the words that I will sing  
  
And I've thrown it all away  
And watched you fall into his arms again  
And I thrown it all away  
Watched you fall, now  
  
And take me back  
Take me home  
Watch me fall  
Down to earth  
Take me back for  
  
This is the start of something beautiful  
You are the start of something new

 

I found your hairband on my bedroom floor  
The only evidence that you've been here before  
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore  
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes  
Never getting dry so I get high smoke in the day then I sleep with the light
on  
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye  
And I'm still drunk by the end of the night  
I don't drink like everybody else  
End up forgetting things about myself  
I'm stubborn I'm forward head's just blocked  
My head's still with you but my hearts just not  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
That's why you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine, but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Everybody said that we'll be together forever but I know that  
I never wanna settle down come around break up the love like Lego now  
Never wanna turn into another like you  
Sleep with my thoughts dance with my views  
Everything's great but everything's short  
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus  
Now I'm in position to be another stalker  
And every thing I say seems to always sound awkward  
Like our last kiss it was perfect but we were nervous  
On the surface  
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it  
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts  
I forget like an elephant or we can use a sedative  
And go back to the day we fell in love on first kiss  
  
So am I close to you anymore if it's over  
And there's no chance that we'll work it out  
Oh you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
  
Because if I was gonna go somewhere I'd be there by now  
And maybe I can let myself down oh  
And thinking I am unaware I keep my feet on the ground  
Keep looking around to make sure I'm not he only one to feel low  
Because if you want I'll take you in my arms  
And keep you sheltered from all that I've done wrong  
And I know you'll say that I'm the only one  
But I know that god made another one of me  
To love you better than I ever will  
  
'Cause you and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied  
You and I ended over U-N-I  
And I said that's fine but you're the only one that knows I lied

 

These thoughts I have could be clear ones and they can seem vivid  
the goals I reach are not near ones the further than limits  
I block her out so when I'm looking through my mind she ain't in it  
Can I be free for a minute, can I be me for a minute?  
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones  
Know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones  
Tell you what I think I will until I depart mum  
It's you that I lived for, I am the first and the last one to love you lots  
  
Whats better than thinking about the ones you love  
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love  
I feel the same when I'm in the floor, see the sun above  
Unconditional like bills paid when I run them up  
No one here to help you pain now you're gonna moan  
No one here to save the day now you're all alone  
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth  
Fact is I wasn't so, I'm coming from a colder zone  
  
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again  
I never close my eyes,  
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you  
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)  
  
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile  
'Cause you're been trespassing, and you won't leave my mind  
Now even think about this, call me say, yes nan  
I'm 31 now I'm still saying yes nan  
You had to replace my mom, dad 2 parents in one  
I know your proud staring at your grandson  
I found a job I like like, got the flat, the cars, the bike, the quad I  
like  
Because of you I'm tireless in every single song I write  
Had a golden life, wanting people to honour mine  
Tell 'em while I'm here, cause one day I'm gonna die  
And when I'm I'm gone I want my music still playin'  
And when my people listen to this track, it's gonna make them wanna cry  
I ain't gonna lie, I think about my scene to say the games better is a must  
now I gotta fly  
My talents gonna shine for surely, fam I know it, I work 'round the clock,  
I don't stop at night.  
  
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again  
I never close my eyes,  
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when (nothing when)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you  
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you)  
My thoughts are only you and my mind is over you  
My thoughts are over you and these words are all for you (all for you).

[Verse:]  
It's another, if it ain't one thing  
Instigators, like pouring fire on propane  
The wrong thing, they be worried about  
Ooh, you know females  
And how they like to run their mouths  
  
Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you  
(like you) you (like you)  
Misery, misery, best company  
Don't let them change your mood  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Between us, they wanna comment  
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend  
Perfect, ain't saying that I am  
Proven, it's proven I don't give a damn  
  
Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)  
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy  
Jealous of you  
That's what they do  
  
[Chorus:]  
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)  
Behind your back (your back, your back)  
Tryin' to tell me that I'm just like the others  
But I ain't all bad  
  
No, no, I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
I ain't all bad  
All bad, all bad  
  
I might make you mad, so mad  
My bad, no, I ain't all bad

 

Sitting here all alone watching the snow fall  
Looking back at the days when we threw them snowballs  
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself  
I need you and nobody else  
I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
'Cause I need you here and I want for you to know  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
And I never wanna do this alone  
Baby I just need you to be here  
Here through the holidays, yeah  
I just wanna know if you feel the same way  
Because I'm lonely baby, want you to hold me baby  
  
And I'm sorry if I pushed you away  
I just want you to know I miss you  
And I want you to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
  
Wrapping gifts without you baby  
Is like mid December and there's no cold  
I can't do this on my own (oh oh oh, oh oh oh)  
I've changed my ways  
We keep running back and forth again  
I'm here to stay  
  
And I don't care if I don't get anything  
All I need is you here right now  
And I'm sorry if I hurt you  
But I know that all I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
This Christmas  
This Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas  
All I want is you this Christmas

 

As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me (love me, love me)  
As long as you love me  
  
We're under pressure,  
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in  
Keep it together,  
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning  
But hey now, you know girl,  
We both know it's a cruel world  
But I will take my chances  
  
As long as you love me  
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
  
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl  
I'll be your Hova, you can be my Destiny's Child on a scene girl  
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly  
Just take my hand  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me, love me  
As long as you love, love me,  
  
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah  
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,  
I'll beat ya there  
Girl you know I got you  
Us, trust  
A couple of things I can't spell without you  
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do  
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view  
Man now we stepping out like whoa (oh God)  
Camera's point and shoot,  
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you, you  
You the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered,  
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,  
It's green where you water it  
So I know we got issues baby true true true  
But I'd rather work on this with you  
Than to go ahead and start with someone new  
As long as you love me  
  
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
As long as you love, love me,  
As long as you love, love me  
  
As long as you love me  
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold  
Love me,  
As long as you love, love me,

Put me in a outfit from the gap like that. One that  
Matches  
With the jacket and the cap like that.  
Then slap me in the stroller with the bounce like that.  
With the bottle full of milk that's 40 ounce like that.  
I'm your b-baby lady.  
Tina - I wanna push you in the buggy.  
I'm your b-baby lady,  
I wanna hold you like a Snuggie.  
You're my baby, lady.  
Tina - And I'm your lady, baby.

[Verse 1]  
Feeling the reminisce  
Gone in an instance  
Blink of an eye  
No goodbye  
I had a notion  
Deep as the ocean  
Blue like the sky  
Oh my  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
But we're the blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
(Woah, woah, woah)  
If I had the chance  
If I had the chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Verse 2]  
There repercussion  
Of missing your loving  
Haunts me at night  
The ghosts are alive  
All of the memories  
Of serenity  
Dwindle in my mind  
All the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Like a permanent stain  
Wishing I could just wash away, away  
Hate our love was in vein  
Who was to blame  
For all the pain  
For all the pain  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you  
  
[Break]  
  
[Chorus]  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
If I had a chance  
If I had a chance  
I'd make us brand new  
I never wanted to be  
Wanted to be  
Your enemy, no, no  
But if I  
If I would have known  
If I would have known  
It could have been you  
Been you

 

There's a dream in my soul  
A fire that's deep inside me  
There's a me no one knows  
Waiting to be set free  
I gonna see that day  
I can feel it  
I can taste it  
Change is coming my way  
  
I was born to be somebody  
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me  
I light up the sky like lighting  
I gonna rise above  
Show 'em what I'm made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
  
This life can kick you around (whoa)  
This world can make you feel small (whoa)  
They will not keep me down (whoa)  
I was born to stand tall  
I can feel it  
I believe it  
I'm here  
I'm here to stay  
  
I was born to be somebody  
Ain't nothin' that's ever gonna stop me  
I light up the sky like lightening  
I gonna rise above  
Show em what I'm made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
  
Feel it  
Believe it  
Dream it  
Be it  
I was born to be somebody  
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me  
Ill light up the sky like lighting  
I'm gonna rise above  
Show em what I'm made of  
I was born to be somebody  
I was born to be  
And this world will belong to me  
Whoa oh  
Whoa oh  
And this world will belong to me  
Ye-ah ye-ah  
Oh  
And this world will belong to me

 

Baby I will not pout  
Baby I will not cry  
Cause I got your love this Christmas time  
When the snow's on the ground  
And it's freezing outside  
I got your love this Christmas  
  
On every list I've ever sent  
You're the gift I'd love the best  
So deck the halls and all the rest  
Warm me up  
With your Christmas love  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
I'm under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
You're my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa I'm cool this year  
My present is standing right here  
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love, yeah  
  
Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room  
Your kinda star, can't be removed  
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song  
And I will forever sing along  
  
On every list I've ever sent  
You're the gift I'd love the best  
So deck the halls and all the rest  
You warm me up  
With your Christmas love  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
I'm under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
You're my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa I'm cool this year  
My present is standing right here  
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love  
  
All the lovers around the world (all the lovers)  
Let me sing you Merry Merry Christmas  
Merry Merry Christmas (and happy holidays)  
And every boy and every girl  
Stay close to the ones you love and thank God above  
That you got someone this year  
That can fill your heart with cheer  
  
Hey angel in the snow  
I'm under the mistletoe  
You are the one  
You're my very own Christmas love  
Tell Santa I'm cool this year

[ 'How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
You were my sun  
You were my earth  
But you didn\'t know all the ways I loved you, no  
So you took a chance  
And made other plans  
I bet you didn\'t think that they would come crashing down, no  
  
You know why?  
Cause in the night, I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless? Oh  
How could you be so heartless?  
  
That\'s why I said,  
Hopped up out the bed  
Turn my swag on  
Take a look in mirror said "what\'s up?"  
Yeah, I\'m gettin money, Ohh, Ohhh  
  
I want the money, money and the cars  
Cars and the clothes, the shows, I suppose  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful, yeah, said  
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

'] 

Oh, oh, oh  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how  
No one has a solid answer  
Just walking in the dark  
And you can see the look on my face  
It just tears me apart  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
So it's up to you and it's up to me  
That we meet in the middle  
On our way back down to earth  
Down to earth, down to earth  
On our way back down to earth  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
(Back down to earth, back down to earth)  
  
Mommy you were always somewhere  
And Daddy I live outta town  
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how  
You tell me this is for the best  
So tell me why am I in tears, woah  
So far away and now I just need you here  
  
So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt)  
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry  
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn)  
And we try, and try, and try, and try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We fell so far away from where we used to be  
Now we're standing, and where do we go  
When there's no road, to get to your heart  
Let's start over again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never thought that it'd be easy  
'Cause we both so distant now  
And the walls are closing in on us  
And we're wondering how.

 

Come, they told me,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
Our new born king to see,  
Pa rum pum pum pum

Pa rum pum pum pum  
To lay before the king,  
Pa rum pum pum pum,  
Ra pum pum pum,

Ra pum pum pum,  
Ra pum pum pum pum pum,  
Yeah I'm on the drum,  
Yeah I'm on the stand drum,  
Yeah I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb,  
And they only spare heat 'cause I'm playing for the sun,  
Playing for the king, playing for the title,  
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible,  
I'm so tight I might go psycho,  
Christmas time so here's a recital,  
I'm so bad like Michael I know,  
I'm still young but I go I go,  
Stupid, stupid, love like cupid,  
I'ma drummer boy so do, do  
  
Little baby,  
Pa rum pum pum pum  
I am a poor boy too,  
Pa rum pum pum pum (gather round the mistletoe real quick)  
I have no gifts to bring,  
(He he matter fact let's gather round the fireplace while we get hot here)  
That's fit to give our king, (Bieber what'd up?)  
Pa rum pum pum pum, (yeah)  
Ra pum pum pum, (yeah)  
Ra pum pum pum (yeah) (I'm gonna get straight to it)  
  
At the table with the family,  
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,  
Then it gave a lil' flicker then  
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer  
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,  
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,  
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,  
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,  
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,  
I said cool, cool,  
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little
bigger,  
Before we work I gotta get this off,  
See the other family members and drop gifts off,  
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,  
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,  
People everywhere and all our twitter followers,  
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!  
  
Mary nodded,  
Pa rum pum pum pum

Pa rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
Rum pum pum pum  
  
If you wanna give it's the time of year,  
JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the stand,  
It's crazy how some people say they don't care,  
When there's people on the street with no food it's not fair,  
It's about time for you to act merrily,  
It's about time for you give to charity,  
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,  
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,  
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,  
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,  
So I think some of you need to act bold,  
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,  
  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do  
Ima drummer boy so do, do

 

Let me tell you a story  
About a girl and a boy  
He fell in love with his best friend when she's around,  
He feels nothing but joy  
But she was already broken,  
And it made her blind  
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right  
But did you know that I loved you  
Or were you not aware?  
Well you're the smile on my face  
And I ain't going nowhere  
I'm here to make you happy,  
I'm here to see you smile  
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while  
  
Who's gonna make you fall  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
Well I can tell you're afraid of  
What this might do  
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose  
Well I don't wanna lose it either  
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe  
So take my hand  
Well did you know you're an angel  
Who forgot how to fly?  
And did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry  
'Cause I know that it piece of you is gone every time he done wrong  
I'm the shoulder you're crying on  
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song, I figure out  
  
What's gonna make you fall in love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
You don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
I will catch you if you fall  
I will catch you if you fall  
Well I will catch you if you fall  
And if you spread your wings  
You can fly away with me  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall  
  
In love  
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart  
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love  
But you can't fly unless you let your  
Let yourself fall oh baby

Lately you've been busy, wondering if you miss me  
Why did you go against me? I just wanna know  
How come you act so different?  
Talk to me I'll listen  
All the love I'm giving  
Don't act like you don't know  
  
I was out there on the road  
Life out of control  
She became a victim to my busy schedule  
And I know that it's not fair  
That don't mean that I don't care  
This one's dedicated to the girl out there  
  
Girl you always catch me at the bad time  
When I know you probably think it's a lie  
I know I told you last time was the last time  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Flatline [x2]  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
Cause when I hit you, you don't even reply  
How could you pull the plug and let me flatline?  
  
Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing  
Said she's leaving, damn I can't believe it  
It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me  
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what imma do now  
  
I was out there on the road  
Life out of control

I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
Girl it's getting late, the sun's going down  
And it's about the time to shake my cross the town  
But before I go, I just wanna say  
That you stay on my mind each and everyday  
  
I think I'm starting to like  
The time that we spend  
And it's building inside  
Then I can't pretend  
  
No I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel  
So I guess it's time for me to say  
That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
Don't know if is love, it's too early to say  
But if it's something like it I just want it to remain  
Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time  
But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine  
Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before  
And if it's a hint of what's to come then maybe can I get some more?  
  
Not trying to be too forward, but I think it's best for you to know  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!  
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to me  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better  
Cause on nights like this, it's good to know that you got someone by your side
like this  
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this  
And then you say, 'hope this will last forever'  
  
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be together  
  
And if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better

[Verse 1]  
Subjected to my system  
Reflecting on the days  
When we used to be just friends  
Protected both our interest  
Our trust was in a bank  
That's where our hearts were safe  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And then we got closer  
Separated from my ex  
Til we got closure  
Oh, in every visit  
Feelings got stronger  
Now this is out our hands  
Our love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I'm a April shower you  
Forever if I May  
'Til your flowers bloom in June  
Make sure that our fireworks  
Be your 4th of July  
For life  
As long as you stand right by my side  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Keep growing closer  
Throughout October  
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve  
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve  
Then we'll be celebrating  
  
[Chorus]  
So get used to me checking in  
All day  
Get used to me falling through  
Just to see your face  
There ain't a moment  
I won't need your brace  
Get used to me touching you  
Get used to me loving you  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, eh  
Oh get used to it, oh and oh  
Get used to me holding you  
Get used to me woeing you  
Oh get used to it  
  
[Bridge]  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
I ain't going nowhere  
I ain't going nowhere, oh no  
Put your faith in me  
I'll be all you need, I swear  
Yeah yeah

So get used to me checking in  
All day

Since the first day I met her I knew she was the one  
Or  
I know she's the one I've been searching for all my life  
Or  
There's not a day that I could go without her, I have to see her beautiful
face  
Or  
Every time I'm with her I fell like if I'm dreaming  
Or  
I just can't stop thinking about her  
Or  
I love everything about her, there's not one thing that I'll ever change about
her  
Or  
There's something about her that makes me fall in love with her within
everyday  
Or  
It's like a dream come true, I still can't believe how a pretty lady like her
fell in love with me  
Or  
She's the best girlfriend I've had so far  
Well that's all I got for now!

 

Girl you don't know how I feel (how I really feel)  
Since you been away, oh baby  
Any chance that you could take my call (take my call), if I got you today  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go  
'Cause I really wanna be alone  
And baby nobody else gotta know  
Just meet me later on the low  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
  
Girl you see me standing here (standing here)  
Standing in the rain(oh baby)  
Any chance that you could stay right here  
And never go away  
  
You say that you don't wanna talk but it's cool  
I've been thinking about you all day long, hoping you pick up your phone  
  
And I know that I don't wanna lose your love, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
  
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go (secret place that we can go)  
'Cause I really wanna be alone (I really wanna be alone)  
And baby nobody else gotta know (nobody else)  
Just meet me later on the low (would you meet me on the low, girl)  
  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (baby don't tell me, no)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking  
Don't tell me you're my heartbreaker (oh baby)  
'Cause girl my heart is breaking (heart is breaking)  
  
So what I'm really trying to say is, and what I hope you understand  
Is despite of all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man  
I know it hasn't been easy for us to talk with everyone being around  
But, this is, this is personal, this is, for me and you  
And I want you to know that I still love you  
And I know the seasons may change  
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain  
But I'm under this umbrella and I'm calling your name  
And you know I don't wanna lose that  
  
(I still believe)  
I still believe in love  
I still believe in us  
I hope you believe in us  
The way I believe in us  
  
You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak  
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya  
And if I had the world in my hands I'd give it all to ya  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I'm feelin'  
I wanna know if you feeling, the way that I, the way that I  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your baby jeans  
  
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart  
Be careful with your heart

 

I always see the girls walk past me  
But they really don't know what I'm like  
I'm funny, talented and stupid  
I hate boys because they try to take my women  
They get on my nerves so I start pokin  
  
So I keep on saying  
I can't stand guys  
They have ugly eyes  
They smell like cats  
And are fats  
They are so stupid  
They act like cupid  
But they don't know I I am your man  
Ha  
(Your man)  
Lalalala  
(Your man)

 

[Verse 1]  
Crying up above, I'm just here to take you away  
Don't worry 'bout a thing, I'm just focused on you today  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Verse 2]  
I see my phone ring, hope it's you babe  
You sent me a picture, well I sent one too  
I'm just tryna keep this love on track  
Oh babe, I got your heart and I won't give it back  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You're laid out  
You were raised up in a poor town  
Roll up, baby roll up  
So hard to leave, but I know I gotta go now  
Paris and London (on top of the world)  
Baby we're so down (will you be my girl?)  
Something I wanna say  
Yeah, you know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
  
[Bridge]  
Holding you close to my heart  
Uh, yeah, so I'm laid back in the Maybach  
Damn these seats go way back  
I was thinking about way back  
When we used to say that  
I was yours, you were mine  
And we fought to pass the time  
And I realized, I realized, that we  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what  
(Babe) no matter what (oh)  
Babe, babe, babe, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart  
I'll be there for you, even though I'm gone  
Holding you close babe, close to my heart

 

[Verse 1]  
My life is a movie and everyone's watching  
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way  
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing  
When the pressure's coming down like lightning  
It's like they want me to be perfect  
When they don't even know that I'm hurting  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
I'll show you  
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel  
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real  
Act like you know me, but you never will  
There's one thing that I know for sure  
  
[Outro: Acoustic]  
I'll show you  
I'll show you

 

Yeah  
J-J-J jb  
Yeah, whoa, whoa  
No, noo,  
  
Now I can see it girl,  
You ain't gotta say nothing  
Your lips are callin me,  
Like they wanna do something,  
  
I feel the chemistry,  
Yeah we got it made,  
A little kiss is a definite possibility,  
Seen you a couple times,  
Had a couple conversations,  
Since you've been on my mind,  
Had a couple observations,  
  
If you a fly chick,  
You could be my chick,  
Play by the rules and  
You could get what I get,  
  
Just keep it quiet,  
Keep it on the hush  
(Yeah, yeah)  
And what we do keep it just between us,  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
I don't want to see a tweet about jb,  
Cause the only people that should know,  
Is you and me so,  
  
Baby, I know that you're cool

You got me all twisted with your lips

Tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell  
Tell me are you gonna kiss me

No one has to do with it,  
Just you and me girl,  
Tellin' will ruin it,  
  
Don't need that tmz,  
All in our privacy,  
Use em' lips for kissin girl,  
If you wanna ride with me,  
  
And if you wanna tell somebody,  
Then we can call the whole thing off,  
No Problem  
  
You can go your way,  
And I'll go mine,  
But I'd rather spend a little time with you,  
Yeah,  
  
Just keep it quiet,  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Keep it on the hush,  
And what we do,  
Keep it just between us,  
(Yeah, yeah)  
  
I don't wanna see a tweet about jb,  
Cause the only people that should know,  
Is you and me so,  
  
Baby, I know that you're cool  
With rockin with me,  
But I can't have you tellin everybody  
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,  
  
So tell me, tell me,

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell,  
Kiss and tell  
  
Oh,  
Don't tell your homies,  
Don't tell you mama,  
Don't tell your girlfriend,  
That'll start some drama,  
  
Stay off that facebook,  
I'll treat you real good,  
You keep this private,  
And you can get what I get,  
(Ohh)  
  
Baby, I know that you're cool  
With rockin with me,  
But I can't have you tellin everybody,  
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,  
  
So tell me, tell me,

Tell me are you gonna kiss, kiss and tell  
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,

If you're gonna kiss and tell  
No, no, no  
If you're gonna kiss and tell,  
If you're gonna kiss and tell,  
That's not me

 

Ended up on a crossroad  
Try to figure out which way to go  
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill  
Running in the same place  
You got your hazard lights on now  
Hoping that somebody would slow down  
Praying for a miracle  
Who'll show you grace?  
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas  
With a long journey ahead  
Seen a truck pull over  
God sent an angel to help you out  
He gave you direction  
Showed you how to read a map  
With a long journey ahead  
Said it ain't over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
  
Relationship on a ski slope  
Avalanche comin' down slow  
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?  
Feels like a blizzard in April  
'Cause my heart is just that cold  
Skating on thin ice  
But it's strong enough to hold us up  
Seen her scream and holler  
Put us both on blast  
Tearing each other down  
When I thought it was over  
God sent us an angel to help us out  
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last  
For that long journey ahead  
Said it ain't ever over  
Oh, even in the midst of doubt  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in  
Life is worth living again  
Life is worth living again  
  
What I'd give for my affection  
Is a different perception  
From what the world may see  
They try to crucify me  
I ain't perfect, won't deny  
My reputation's on the line  
So I'm working on a better me  
  
Life is worth living  
Life is worth living, so live another day  
The meaning of forgiveness  
People make mistakes  
Only God can judge me  
Life is worth living again  
Another day  
Life is worth living again

 

My friends say I'm a fool  
To think that you're the one for me  
I guess I'm just a sucker for love  
'Cause honestly the truth is  
That you know I'm never leavin'  
'Cause you're my angel sent from above  
  
Baby you can do no wrong  
My money is yours  
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya  
With me, girl, is where you belong  
Just stay right here  
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
People try to tell me  
But I still refuse to listen  
'Cause they don't get to spend time with you  
A minute with you is worth more than  
A thousand days without your love, oh your love  
  
Oh, baby you can do no wrong  
My money is yours  
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya  
With me, girl, is where you belong  
Just stay right here  
I promise my dear I'll put nothin' above ya, above ya  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
My heart is blind but I don't care  
'Cause when I'm with you everything has disappeared  
And every time I hold you near  
I never wanna let you go, oh  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me  
  
Love me, love me  
Say that you love me  
Fool me, fool me  
Oh how you do me  
Kiss me, kiss me  
Say that you miss me  
Tell me what I wanna hear  
Tell me you love me

 

Walkin on red dirt no concrete pavement  
Navy blue book bag on my back  
  
Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station  
Hope they let me ride away with them  
  
Got pretty mad at my father today  
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say  
  
As I'm singin an old song she used to sing  
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
So I turn around and headed to the old run down building  
Bells gonna ring before I make it back  
  
I watch the upper class men drive right past me  
Wish they'd let me ride away with them  
  
Still haven't got over it yet  
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear  
  
My ipods the same tune my mother would sing  
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to  
  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away  
I do  
I wanna run away from you  
I wanna leave this school  
I do  
I wanna leave this town  
I do  
But she'll be worried sick if  
I do (if I do)  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away, run away  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't  
  
Never get mad enough to walk out  
If I do then I won't be gone for long  
  
Never fed up enough to leave her  
No matter what I'll love her just the same  
  
That's my mama  
Yeah  
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon  
  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home  
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys  
Just don't run away  
Run away, yeah  
Can't run away and leave my mama alone  
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy  
Just don't

 

[ 'I chasing a  
Ilucion this down  
The moon shows me a  
Shortcut to town.  
This is strange, strange I know

Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
I feel in your heart more, more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah!  
A misstep - tep.  
  
As in the horror movie to be lame  
I just love these here is the same  
A small and neglect is the end  
No no the end... Yeah!  
Finds it a new way to say now  
Commenters a way to feel now  
This is live, my love, your ball  
Back to losing control.  
  
Woohha-a-ohooh

Never say never (never never never)  
  
You see I never thought that I could walk through fire (aye)  
I never thought that I could take the burn  
I never had the strength to take it higher  
Until I reach the point of no return  
  
And there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
It's my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never (ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
(Ne-never say never)  
Never say it, never, never say it  
  
I never thought that I could feel this power (aye)  
I never thought that I could feel this free  
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower  
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)  
  
'Cause there's just no turnin' back  
When your heart's under attack  
Gonna give everything I have  
'Cause this is my destiny  
  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Here we go  
Guess who?  
J-Smith and J-B!  
I gotcha lil' bro  
I can handle him  
Hold up, aight?  
I can handle him  
  
Now he's bigger than me  
Taller than me  
And he's older than me  
And stronger than me  
And his arms a little bit longer than me  
But he ain't on a J-B song with me  
  
I be trying to chill  
They try to sour the thrill  
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will  
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove  
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)  
  
I gotta be the best, and yes  
We're the fliest  
Like David and Goliath,  
I conquered the giant  
So now I got the world in my hand,  
I was born from two stars  
So the moon is where I land  
(I'm gone)  
  
Yeah  
I will never say never (I will fight)  
I will fight till forever (make it right)  
Whenever you knock me down  
I will not stay on the ground  
Pick it up, pick it up  
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up)  
And never say never  
  
Never say never  
  
I will never say never (never say never)

First, I'll acknowledge  
All trust has been broken  
A successful recovery  
I pray for us at night  
  
Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
Just tryna make it right.  
  
Make it right  
Make it right  
Make it right  
This time I'll do you right  
  
Missing your good intentions  
Missing you from a distance  
Hope you did the same  
  
I know that I caused a problem  
Know that I left you livid  
Pushed you far away  
  
Learned it don't pay to lie  
Cause I don't wanna see you cry  
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast  
I'ma hold it back inside  
  
But now that I'm back around ya  
Nothing else really matters  
Hope you feel the same  
  
First, I'll acknowledge  
All trust has been broken  
A successful recovery  
I pray for us at night  
  
Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
Just tryna make it right.  
  
Make it Right  
Make it right  
Make it right  
This time I'll do you right  
  
I'm going through all the motions  
Trying to find a reason  
That we ended that way  
  
Nothing in life is perfect  
We'll be changing like the seasons  
That's what they used to say  
  
If it's going to sleep alone at night  
I don't wanna close my eyes  
Wanna give you all I have to give  
I'm not holdin back this time  
  
Now that I'm back around ya,  
Nothin around me matters  
Hope you feel the same  
  
First, I'll acknowledge  
All trust has been broken  
A successful recovery  
I pray for us at night  
  
Grants me with a second chance  
Never thought I'd see your face again  
Learning life through trial and error  
And tryna make it right.  
  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
Make it right (make it right, make it right)  
This time I'll do you right  
  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right  
I'ma do you right  
You know I'ma do you right

 

Visual visual JB  
Yo 'Ye whattup  
  
Raekwon  
You got stacks like the international house of pancakes  
All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes  
Palms is sweat it, don't regret  
Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck  
  
It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?  
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap  
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica  
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego  
  
It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is  
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us  
Fly walls down in the fly halls  
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall  
All about money tied in a know stand over there  
That's why I make it happen on blocks  
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather  
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta  
  
You see my baby over hit the road  
Where she's going I swear nobody knows  
I need to find her before another man does  
I wouldn't want him to steal my love  
  
I'm just tryin to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool)  
What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah)  
I'm just tryin to find, find, find  
That sweet love of mine  
  
I'm runnin outta time  
Where is my runway love  
Searching low and high  
Know that I'm not givin' up  
I give it all up for her  
I'll never be enough  
I wont stop until I find  
My runaway love  
  
Last name West and my teeth Diamonds  
She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?  
Listen to Wu Tang  
Trying crazy suits on  
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's  
Shorts is the coogies  
Open up the door when you take her to the movies  
  
When you meet the parents you tell De Niro  
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo  
Next show they gotta up the zeroes  
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old  
  
The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me  
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me  
The young youth rocking the gold tooth  
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules  
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'  
You looking good fly color Asian  
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia  
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia  
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's  
(Sweet runaway love)  
Guess that's the day she became a runaway love  
  
I'm runnin outta time  
Where is my runaway love  
Searching low and high  
Know that I'm not givin' up  
I give it all up for her  
I'll never be enough  
I wont stop until I find  
My runaway love  
  
Why can't I find, the love of mine,  
When you're standing in front of my face  
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine  
How did I let you get away  
  
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly  
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck  
Grabbing em on set  
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get  
Take that queen assure to ya  
We can live every month baby girl just call me up  
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes  
Even the stress  
  
My mind is a terrible thing to waste  
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss  
Me my lady left my homies  
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony  
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling  
I need my honey in my life get that film it  
Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine  
My runaway love give me mine come on  
  
I'm runnin outta time  
Where is my runaway love  
Searching low and high

I wont stop until I find  
My runaway love  
  
I'm runnin outta time

[ '[Verse:]  
She dances in the sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances \'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep...  
  
She dances at the break of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She can\'t be late, can\'t take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
[Chorus:]  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love  
  
She dances for the men at work  
Who works her all the time  
She can\'t be rude as she says so  
"I must be home tonight"  
  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
She sets his food an hour late  
She must be out of her mind...  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love  
  
She works so hard, just to make her way  
For a man who just won\'t appreciate  
  
And don\'t know it takes  
And was all in vain.  
Still she could not stop,  
Couldn\'t break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore she\'d dance no more  
But then she did, she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home, home  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm  
She\'s a slave to the rhythm of  
A slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love

Mmmm mmm yeah  
Do do do do do do do-do  
Ohh Yeah  
  
Gotta change my answering machine  
Now that I'm alone  
Cuz right now it says that we  
Can't come to the phone  
And I know it makes no sense  
Cuz you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
It's ridiculous  
It's been months  
And for some reason I just  
Can't get over us  
And I'm stronger than this  
Enough is enough  
No more walkin round  
With my head down  
I'm so over being blue  
Cryin over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calender I have  
That's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you  
There's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you  
And your memory  
And how every song reminds me  
Of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Stupid love songs  
Don't make me think about her smile  
I'm letting go  
Turning off the radio  
  
Cuz I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishing you was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishin' you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
Why can't I turn off the radio?

 

With you,  
With you,  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place  
  
Now Romeo and Juliet,  
Bet they never felt the way we felt,  
Bonnie and Clyde,  
Never had to hide like,  
We do,  
We do  
  
You and I both know it can't work,  
It's all fun and games,  
'Til someone gets hurt,  
And I don't,  
I won't let that be you  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
There might be something real between us two, who knew?  
Now we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
'Cause I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like Adam and Eve,  
Tragedy was our destiny,  
Like Sunny and Cher,  
I don't care,  
I got you baby  
  
See we both,  
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,  
'Cause ain't no way,  
It's gonna end right but,  
We are both too foolish to stop  
  
Now you don't wanna let go,  
And I don't wanna let you know,  
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?  
And we don't wanna fall but,  
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,  
And I know you can't love me here  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we had is stuck in the moment 'cause,  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you  
  
See like,  
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be,  
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,  
And I ain't with it,  
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,  
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,  
But convention's telling us to let go,  
So we'll never know  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
'Cause everything we did,  
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
Yeah  
  
I wish we had another time,  
I wish we had another place,  
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,  
And there's nothing my heart can do,  
(Nothing my heart can do),  
To fight with time and space 'cause, (and space)  
I'm still stuck in the moment with you,  
Yeah,

 

Verse 1:

[Bridge:]  
[Chorus:]

Tell me your fantasies  
And I guarantee that you won't ever wanna leave  
  
So listen you on your way

And that screaming  
Are you ready baby?

But I ain't tryna go to sleep

Cause it's time for bed

Cause it's time for bed

Time for bed

[ 'Why does she even obsess about her life with me  
She\'s like "I don\'t need you! Just let me be!"  
Why doesn\'t she ever care me, you see  
Well I\'m done with her and she\'s done with me!  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she\'s gone  
Even though I\'m writing this song  
She\'s not there any more  
Oh, she\'s not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it\'s hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don\'t why she\'d fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don\'t wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can\'t avoid her stress  
  
(Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh) (2x)  
  
Flashback, we were nice and cuddly then  
But then you broke my heart and let go of my hand  
Didn\'t this of this relationship to end like this  
You could have just gave me a hug or kiss (on the cheek)  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she\'s gone  
Even though I\'m writing this song  
She\'s not there any more  
Oh, she\'s not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it\'s hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don\'t why she\'d fuss  
What does she want from me

That girl is never coming back today  
Hey!  
What do you say?  
She never wants to see me anyway  
  
You know, I thought of her as my love  
And I miss her now that she\'s gone  
Even though I\'m writing this song  
She\'s not there any more  
Oh, she\'s not there any more  
  
What does she want from me  
I guess it\'s hard to see  
Everything she does  
I don\'t why she\'d fuss  
What does she want from me  
Don\'t wanna let her be  
Why is she so obsessed  
She can\'t avoid her stress (2x)  
  
Whoa, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh (Repeat until end)  
(What does she want)

Where are you now  
When I need you the most  
Why don't you take my hand

Help me to stay strong  
  
So take my hand and walk with me  
Show me what to be  
I need you to set me free  
Yeah  
  
Where are you now

Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breathe like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
Taken by surprise, because I felt so secure.  
Because all the things, that you've done,  
Have let me wondering  
  
We may not agree on this, but let's not fight  
Because who cares who is wrong or right? I  
Feel like I can't breath like this--your  
Grip is too tight  
  
You leave me breatheless with your words.  
  
We can say that we've changed, together  
Another day--give me your hand, let me  
Explain, because I've come to terms with  
Who you are.

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
And I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas  
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
'Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You, baby  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children  
Laughter fills the air  
  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door

I just sit here waiting for you to call  
Then I wonder if you're even calling at all  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm still sitting here waiting for much more (Text me or something)  
I can't take this, I'm walking out that door  
So many thought go through my mind

Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you

Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I pack up my things and get on that plane  
Cause without you I can't be tamed  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you

The sun comes up on another morning  
My mind never wakes up without you on it  
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams  
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?  
  
We were best of friends since we were this high  
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by  
We would be on the phone all day  
Now I can't find the words to say to you  
Now what I'm supposed to do  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
In my head we're already together  
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better  
I just wanna see you smile  
You say the word and I'll be right there  
I ain't never going nowhere  
  
I'm just trying to see where this can take us  
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious  
I think I finally got it done  
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror  
And say it to her, her yeah  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)  
Or should I moving closer just be still  
How would I know?  
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand  
Will everything change?  
How do I know if she feels the same?  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Catching feelings, catching feelings

 

[Verse]  
What about the children?  
Look at all the children we can change  
What about a vision?  
Be a visionary for a change  
We're the generation  
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?  
We're the inspiration  
Do you believe enough to die for it?  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Oh yeah  
  
Who's got the heart?

What about the children?  
Look at all the children we can change  
What about a vision?  
Be a visionary for a change  
We're the generation  
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?  
We're the inspiration  
Do you believe enough to die for it?  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve

Hello!

 

It's a holiday  
Spend it with you baby  
I think that I am in love this Christmas, yeah  
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace  
You know that Santa's coming to town  
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now  
  
So today is all about you babe  
The mistletoe can pull us closer  
It's what I'm waiting for  
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's  
  
So in on top of your roof  
Them sleigh bells is ringing  
I'll be up all night with you  
Don't care what they're saying  
Japan to Peru, baby me and you  
This Christmas Eve  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me  
I got you babe, whoa oh  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
You leave some cookies out,  
I'ma eat 'em up  
Nobody can see me but you  
It's so magical  
  
When we use imagination,  
We can fly to never never land  
The North Pole, ain't that cold  
If you wanna go  
I got you baby  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me  
I got you babe, whoa oh  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Christmas  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve

Be my holiday, my dream

Kissing underneath the tree

You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve

 

I can see  
All the children around the world  
Crying tears of deceit  
And their parents are to blame  
Christmas is dead  
And that children should cry no more  
All of it is just fake  
There's no sense to believing in  
Putting your kids health at risk  
And its causing mental illnesses around the world  
So, Christmas is dead  
And pretend its just another day  
  
Santa claus is fake  
And children will cry  
In order to admit the truth  
When you say Christmas is the perfect time of year  
I should put you to the test  
I will say  
You are careless  
That's wrong  
And you'll understand  
How the truth will set you free and change you  
Christmas is dead

 

Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away  
  
Tv light of blue and white  
Just can't fall asleep at night  
Move over to the space where you should be  
Even half way seem so far  
Over mountains and diamond stars  
Everybody has their own way home  
  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
All my life I've dreamed of love  
Never thought it would hurt this much  
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return  
So I'll be strong and hold on to  
A picture and a thought of you  
Getting all the love that you deserve  
  
So come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away

 

Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again, woo woo woo  
You're the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me,  
Is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
Girl, without you I'm lost  
Can't face this compass at heart  
Between me and love,  
You're the common denominator  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Common denominator  
Oh, yeah, woa  
  
Before you're love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side, aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say,  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be love's reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin'  
Imma hold it down for you, you  
You, woah, oh, woah  
You're the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I don't wanna go back  
I don't want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again

 

Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright,  
Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright  
  
Say you love me  
As much as I love you yeah  
Would you hurt me baby  
Could you do that to me yeah  
Would you lie to me baby  
'Cause the truth hurts so much more  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy  
Leave my heart still at the door?  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl  
  
(Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright) Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy  
But it sure is worth a try  
  
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool  
'Cause I love too hard  
Are there any rules baby  
If this a lesson  
Then baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl  
  
Basically I'm saying here  
I can't live without my baby  
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah  
Ain't no need for contemplating  
Promise you won't keep me waiting  
Tell me baby, I'm all that you need

'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right

'Cause you only got one chance, for your first dance  
Yeah you never forget your first dance

When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,  
We've both been waiting so long  
For this day to come

I'm gonna cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a life time  
  
I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth  
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor

Before the lights go up and the music turns off  
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,  
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll  
Make it before the clock strikes nine  
  
If you just give, give the first dance to me

If it has some wings, we'd be flying, we'd be soaring

No-o-o  
But I'm thinking that you're winning if you make it to the top  
That probably means you make me feel some type of way  
Shout-out Miami for having so many foreign babes

I have often dreamed  
Of a far off place  
Where a hero's welcome  
Would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer  
When they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying  
This is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday  
I can go the distance  
I will find my way  
If I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while  
When I go the distance  
I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road  
To embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander  
It will lead me to you  
And a thousand years  
Would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime  
But somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back  
I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track  
No, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope  
But I won't lose hope  
'Till I go the distance  
And my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star  
I will go the distance  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far  
I can go the distance  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
'Till I find my hero's welcome

Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
Don't be afraid to stand alone  
Don't be afraid to stand outside all by yourself  
I know it's hard away from home  
It ain't easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin' to your significant other all night long  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
[Pooh Bear]  
Should've been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now you're standin' right in front of me  
It is mean and though, that life  
Try to protect your feelins  
Givin' in between the lines  
Hope your heart is totally healed and  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

 

But yesterday we were  
I don't understand?  
  
We started out it was perfect  
Nothing but fun  
And my heart was convinced  
To say that you're the one  
  
And I thought it would last the rest of our lives  
Boy was I in for a big surprise,  
With no doubt looking round  
Thinking that I'm so cool  
  
Same place, same time  
Every day of my life could we meet after school  
Finally if I didn't make her cry  
She wouldn't be with another guy  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Now I'm all tore up taking up  
When I was at your door  
For the first time when you said  
Forever I'll be yours  
Started walking your hand in my hand  
Feelings got stronger  
  
We made a promise.  
  
And whenever I leave it feels like you're still with me  
But it all came crashing down  
Sitting in my room  
I gotta get out of here  
What am I to do when I look up  
And you're not there.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Say I'm to young for love  
I got so much live to live ahead  
But if only this love?  
I could get over  
I know I have to deal with the pain.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here

 

[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you love me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you loved me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Take it one day at a time  
Reach for the stars now  
Ooh just leave the past behind  
That's a part of living, woah  
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah  
  
[Outro]  
If only I could hit the ground  
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be falling down  
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be touching down  
If only I could hit the ground

 

Every birthday, every birthday  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Don't let this go to your head  
But you're the best, I've ever had  
Not to mention  
That thing is swollen  
You got me oh so in a trance  
  
Something like a Ziploc, but a lip lock  
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch  
Oh, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Got me tossing, turning in the bed  
Your place is where I rather be instead  
You don't know your strength  
Missing you is like adrenaline  
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock  
What a great spot  
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won't stop  
No, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go, no babay  
  
Holding back the faces I would make  
I'm a fan and you're the rock star  
Making it hard on me  
Visualize a monster  
'Cause you're too bad for me  
Shot that arrow, I'm hit  
Need you right near me  
Trying to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away (no, no)  
I try to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go

 

Looking out the window  
Waiting for your headlights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight  
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Pacing down the hallway  
Trying to fight the urge to call  
I could almost hear a pin drop  
'Cept for the clock on the wall  
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
I'm praying that you make it home tonight  
So we can lay down by the fireside  
You and I till Christmas morning  
There's nothing else that I want this year  
More than just to have you here, whoa  
I'll be waiting  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Looking out the window  
Waiting for your head lights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight

I don't work hard when it's easy  
I put in work when it's hard  
Girl they never believed in love until I had yours  
This is more than a season  
And I'm not just sprung  
I'm not afraid to tell you that you're the one  
But when I wake up thinking 'bout  
The one that I can run to when I'm feeling down  
Life is so good when you're around  
Girl nobody from the past is beating you right now  
Cause I'll take you home to mama, let you meet my friends  
Cause you don't come with drama  
So I want you till the world ends  
You're way more than worth it  
But I don't feel like I deserve it  
You got the pieces  
You're my kind of perfect

Verse 1:  
The strands in your eyes  
They color them wonderful  
Stop me was stealing my breath  
The emeralds from mountains  
The thrust toward the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me  
That we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartbreak  
That hang from above  
  
Chorus:  
And i'll be you're crying shoulder  
I'll be love suicide  
And i'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life  
(x2)  
  
Verse 2:  
I've dropped out  
I've bearned up

Repeat Chorus

Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it  
It ain't a problem, baby girl when you're with it  
Tell me what you wanna do, would you make a move now?  
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feeling  
(Look at her face)  
Girl ain't gotta say anymore  
(Say no more)  
Need to know I ain't playing  
(I ain't playing)  
Baby what are we waiting for?  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night  
You might mess around and fall in love  
And I might be the guy  
I don't want to make you fall in love with me  
Girl, what's your name, I'm happy that you came  
I'm the man in this, stick with me, I can't love  
Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop  
  
[Verse 3: Quavo]  
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me  
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 B-T  
I asked her what's her name - got the note she said Hammer  
On the way to the mattress, said she loved the Panamera  
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers  
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae in the pot when I beat it  
Take her across the country, I got plugs on the Visa  
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him  
  
[Verse 4: Takeoff]  
He never seen a nigga like me  
Hoppin' out the Chevy, step up with the minks, gold chain, Mr. T  
In the summer, with the beach, with the hummer, with the leather seat  
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I bet they watching me  
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli  
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch calling me call me your majesty  
  
[Verse 5: Offset]  
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage  
I run to the money like Forrest  
My life is historic  
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit  
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon  
I watch her like a telescope  
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil Terrio  
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows  
I'm young and always riding in a Phantom Ghost  
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo  
  
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]  
Tonight might be the night  
You might mess around and fall in love  
And I might be the guy  
I don't want to make you fall in love with me  
Girl, what's your name, I'm happy that you came  
I'm the man in this, stick with me, I can't love  
Everywhere around the world  
I'll be looking for you  
  
[Hook: Quavo]  
Is it her looking for you, looking for you?  
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker  
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you  
Not the feds or a cop

[Verse 1]  
For all the times that you rain on my parade  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness' sake  
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Bridge]  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself

 

[Verse 1]  
Love is in the air  
Candles all around us  
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing  
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever  
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Babe, you are the reason to breathe  
And babe, you know you're all that I need  
Remember when you took my hand  
And ran away (it was just us two babe)  
And wandered off to Chinatown  
Laughing 'bout nothing at all  
When I look into your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)

She says she met me on a tour  
She keeps knocking on my door,  
She won't leave me, leave me alone  
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops  
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, oh  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene  
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love  
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth  
She's faking, faking it all  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, yeah  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?  
That ain't my baby, no, that ain't my girl

Saying goodbye, but how could ya  
You throw this, you throw this  
Your foolishness, seduces

[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words  
  
[Verse]  
So you heard it all before  
Falling in and out of trust  
Trying to rekindle us  
Only to lose yourself  
But I won't let me lose you  
And I won't let us just fade away  
After all that we've been through  
I'ma show you more than I ever could say  
  
[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words

 

It's the most beautiful time of the year

I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face

Reindeer flyin' through the sky so high

Your lips on my lips, that's a merry merry Christmas

Ooh no, ooh no, ooh  
They say that hate has been sent  
So let loose the talk of love  
Before they outlaw the kiss  
Baby give me one last hug  
  
There's a dream  
That I've been chasing  
Want so badly for it to be reality  
(Reality, reality)  
And when you hold my hand  
Then I understand  
That it's meant to be  
  
Cause baby when you're with me

Oh no, don't have a care in the world  
Why would I, when you are here  
(You are here, you are here)  
There's a moment I've been chasin'  
And I finally caught it out on this floor  
(On this floor, in this floor)  
  
Baby, there's no hesitation,  
No reservation by taking a chance and more  
Oh no, because

[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now

Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl

I need a one dance

One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me

[ '[Verse 1: justin bieber]  
Damn damn j.b, where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds  
2 big face rollies, no I ain\'t lyin\'  
Making momma so proud that she cryin\'  
Yeah you say I\'m crazy? guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu  
So I\'m heading for the gold, I\'m sweating  
I swear otis redding will be oh-so ready  
I already got ahead-y of the game, I\'m with kenny  
And we steady getting many, I mean money  
Riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses  
  
[Justin bieber]  
Wait... I\'m not done  
  
[Verse 2: justin bieber]  
I thanked jesus at the awards I\'m never going to hell  
Call me zack morris I\'m saving you by the bell  
My girl says I\'m perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bee\'s cause baby I\'m a money tree  
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y  
Possibly you\'re probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally  
There\'s a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out, I should make history  
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Can\'t you see the private jets flying over you?  
I ain\'t even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus, no they shouldn\'t be a photoshoot  
It\'s funny how you wanna take my picture and it\'s like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that "it\'s not mine"  
Just calm down, you don\'t gotta hurry  
Don\'t be nervous, you don\'t gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I\'d be blurry

Its everywhere that I go  
Children are crying  
Soldiers are dying  
Some people don't have a home  
  
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Can you tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
  
I lose my appetite,  
Knowing kids starve tonight  
Am I a sinner,  
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate  
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference  
And its starting today  
  
'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Heaven tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and  
Pray for the broken-hearted  
I pray for the life not started  
I pray for all the lungs not breathing  
I pray for all the souls in need  
I pray  
Can you give 'em one today  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Can someone tell how to make a change?  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and I pray

Verse 1  
Is it okay, to show my face? I'm wondering if I  
Can talk to you, you're being rude, and there's no need to cry you departed

For whatever that I did to you  
From party to party and shots of Bacardi

Don't spend enough time with you(that's why)  
You don't spend enough time with me(that's right)

Give me a second chance, girl a second chance  
Give me a second chance. Ima be a better man  
And I promise girl, I will do what I can  
To let you know that I am a changed man  
Verse 2  
You tell your friends, that you don't know, what ima do next  
You're scared of me, no need to be, it's not like I'm your ex  
Standing here, close to tears, christmas cheers, happy new years  
Neither can replace the fact that you're gone  
Truth is so visible it's almost crystal clear  
Girl it's plain to see I,

Things seemed strange this morning  
As I packed my bags for school  
The smiles I'm used to seein' just weren't there  
I heard my father talking  
To my mother down the hallway  
Above the whispers all that I could hear... Was  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
I was feeling kinda helpless  
About the words that I just heard  
Could it be the family 2 doors down  
They said a couple months of bad luck  
Had them up against the wall  
And though it may seem small  
I know there's something I can do...  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
Make room at your table  
For your friends and family  
Take the time to share your day  
Just laugh talk and eat  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
... There's a little hope for you and i

'Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side  
'Cause she gets the light that is in me  
But she don't know, she don't know  
  
She don't like the lights  
She don't like the lights

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys  
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm December our hearts will see  
A world where men are free  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas we'll see a land  
No hungry children and no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world where people care  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears  
One shining moment my heart ran away  
From our world today  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas man will not fail  
Take hope because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
Someday at Christmas time

 

[Verse 1]  
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty,  
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies.  
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?  
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness.  
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice,  
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times.  
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight,  
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, yeah,  
Sorry.  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to,  
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two.  
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth,  
Can we both say the words and forget this?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no),  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body, your body!.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes,  
I'm making you're sadder than you realize  
I could make you smile and feel a little more related.  
We really click, would it be so wrong if we just dated?  
Let us goooo... Jump on my skateboard, eat some cake, along  
The lake  
I'll do all your favorite stuff right off the cuff cause we're  
Spontaneous.  
Let's hop a bus to shop, we'll check out Filene's, and  
Get chunky jewelry at Chico's.  
I'll buy you a panini, and some Spanks to make you teeny  
... You're the lady with the big brown eyes

 

[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 1]  
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying  
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?  
To keep you warm  
I showed you the game everybody else was playing  
That's for sure  
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying  
Oh lord  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most

So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 2]  
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken  
Yes I did  
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open  
Just admit it  
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping  
Can't deny it  
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping  
Tell me...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Couldn't find you anywhere  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I was by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
I need you the most

 

A tornado flew around my room before you came  
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain  
In southern california, much like arizona  
My eyes don't she'd tears, girl, they bawl  
  
I've thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' about forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' about forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
(Jaden smith rap):  
I been thinking 'bout you and you know I do  
When I be thinking 'bout them kisses girl so are you  
Man I heard some things I don't know it's true  
But people say you really like me and I hope that's true  
You my baby girl and I hope you know it,  
A boy will tell you that he loves you but a man will show it  
That's why you in my arms  
Just for the day  
Coz let so much go by you be dancing away but let's just have some fun girl  
As long as your here coz when you get up on that plane you be gone for a year  
And when you come up in my room I'll be bawling some tears but people say just
live in the moment it's wrong to be scared girl is it wrong to be scared  
Coz that's what they say and every day that I don't see you, you slippin'
away,  
And all my teachers in my class thinkin' I'm crazy but they don't know that I
think about you daily coz I be  
  
Thinkin' 'bout you  
(Ooh, no, no, no)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
(You know, know, know)  
I've been thinkin' 'bout you  
Do you think about me still?  
Do ya, do ya?  
  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)  
Do you not think so far ahead?  
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (oooh, oooh)  
  
(Justin bieber rap):  
Baby I could pick you up in the roll royce  
Anywhere you wanna go it's your choice  
Every time that I'm away girl I miss your voice  
And I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys  
I came from the bottom now  
I'm at the top tell you I love you every day and that I'll never stop  
They say it's true love well is love true  
Yeah I think it's love that's why I found you  
And a second that'll go by that don't think you are so fly  
And I know why ain't no guy gonna treat you like I wanna,  
Gonna be the man that treat you right  
Be the man to hold you tight

[Hook - Justin Bieber]  
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from  
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until it's done  
And I don't mean to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young  
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you  
I'm on one, you know, I'm on one  
I said I'm on one, you know, I'm on one  
Two white cups and I got that drink could be purple could  
Be pink depending on how you mix that ish money that  
We got, never get that ish, cause I'm on one, you know I'm one one  
  
You know what I like  
Oh yeah, oh yeah (x2)  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
You just need to listen, teach you how to fix it  
Cause you're cause I don't trust these women  
I don't trust these women, they might catch me slipping  
So, you're the only one cause I don't trust these women  
They might catch me slipping and put in something different  
So you're the only one cause I don't trust these bitches  
I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me simping  
So you're the only one  
  
Trust issues  
  
[Verse]  
Drizzy Drake, check me out  
Coming live from the mothafucking North Side  
Kick game, run game, run it real good  
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside  
Same nigga that you knew way back when  
You acting like it's somebody you don't know  
Tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends  
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?  
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell  
Certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess that they don't really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still, let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them  
I'm all day with it man, A. M to the P. M  
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
That's that ish that drives me crazy  
And that's all I've been getting lately  
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in  
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them  
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

They don't know  
What love is like  
Love is like appreciation  
Mixed in a double cup of sprite  
  
So can we go  
No left or right  
You go your way  
And I'll go mine  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say  
Cuz I'm here to stay

Places that I've been

You gotta have strength  
And when it goes down  
And it's all said and done  
  
You gotta stand up to them  
There's no need to run  
And now that I've made it  
I won't look back no  
Sacrifice what meant the most to me  
The most to me  
Yes I did  
  
Cuz this is my time  
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say

Set it free.  
Never be scared to make change, effectively.  
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively.  
Every person in this world can do good.  
I just want this message understood.  
Alright... Stop.  
Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no
division.  
Religion.  
Everybody needs a mission. Haters need to stop it, just listen.  
  
[Sean Kingston]  
I see them coming, yeah.  
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.  
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
I, I see them coming, coming.  
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.  
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.

 

What day is it? And in what month?  
This clock never seemed so alive  
I can't keep up and I can't back down  
I've been losing so much time  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right  
I'm tripping on words  
You've got my head spinning  
I don't know where to go from here  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
There's something about you now  
I can't quite figure out  
Everything she does is beautiful  
Everything she does is right  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
And me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

 

You've got the mother load.  
You've got the stuff I like.  
Everytime I'm with you babe,  
I just get psyched.  
Like bling in your mouth but it's just old fillings.  
Dry skin on your hands, and your so cracked,  
Like (this part is mumbled in the video),  
Sittin on ur bed with your jacked up back.  
Hey girl, I want to watch you do you pilates, and skip  
The hard part.  
Cuz baby, you've got the mother load.
